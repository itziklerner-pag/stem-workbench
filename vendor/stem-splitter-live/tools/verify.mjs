 * Owned by Release Engineering. It does not contain any product logic; it runs
 * the suites the people who own the product wrote, in a fixed order, and prints
 * one summary at the end. Every child's stdout is streamed AND tee'd to
 * `out/verify/<step>.log`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two things it knows that a bare `&&` chain does not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. `tools/run-ext.mjs` needs a live fixture and its built-in default
 *    (`spike/audio/mix_full.wav`) is NOT in the repo — `spike/audio/` is
 *    .gitignored and the file arrives via `spike/fetch_audio.sh`. On a fresh
 *    clone the flag is mandatory. This script checks the fixture (and the model
 *    seed) exist BEFORE launching a browser, and says exactly which command to
 *    run if they do not, instead of failing eight minutes in.
 *
 * 2. One block of `run-ext.mjs` is genuinely flaky and it is understood why.
 *    `AGENTS.md`: inference time OSCILLATES with a period longer than 180 s
 *    (753 <-> 1002 ms at hop 1.0, no trend). The harness' hop-1.0 backpressure
 *    section runs for 35 s, so it samples ONE phase of that cycle: on the fast
 *    phase the ladder barely fires, on the slow phase it fires constantly and
 *    the timing-derived assertions in that block can miss. Same build, same
 *    machine, ~1 run in 2. Those specific assertions — and only those — are
 *    reported as FLAKY-KNOWN and do not turn the run red. Everything else,
 *    including every other assertion in the same file, is a hard failure.
 *
 * The excuse list is deliberately narrow, is printed in full whenever it fires,
 * and is scoped to the hop-1.0 section by its section header. A new assertion
 * added to that block is a hard failure until someone adds it here on purpose.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. A SUITE THAT NOTHING RUNS IS NOT A SUITE (added 2026-08-15)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * For one batch this file ran four steps while SIX self-checked suites existed
 * in the tree — `extension/engine/pitch.js`, `extension/engine/chroma.js`,
 * `embed/autonav.js`, `embed/ui/embed-state.js`, `tools/build-embed.mjs` and
 * `tools/embed-smoke.mjs`. Every one of them exits non-zero on failure and
 * every one of them was invisible to `node tools/verify.mjs`. `AGENTS.md`
 * called embed-smoke "its gate" while the gate never invoked it.
 *
 * That is the VOID rule at the level of the RUNNER: a suite nobody runs
 * reports green for exactly the same reason an empty stdout does. It is also
 * worse than a red, because a red gets investigated. They are all in `steps`
 * now; the four pure ones and the build are in `--quick` because together they
 * cost about eight seconds, and `embed-smoke` sits with `e2e` because it drives
 * a real Chromium.
 *
 * The cost of admitting them was in the two parsers below, not in the plan:
 * three of the six print neither `N passed, M failed` nor `all checks passed`,
 * so on the first attempt they came out VOID — the runner correctly refusing to
 * call an unrecognised summary a pass. `ASSERTED` and `summarise()` learned
 * their shapes, and `--self-check` now pins each shape so a suite changing its
 * summary line cannot quietly become a VOID again.
 *
 * IT HAPPENED AGAIN THE SAME DAY, which is why this note is a standing rule and
 * not an incident report. The engine integration landed
 * `extension/engine/pitchbank.js` (24 checks) and `extension/engine/keytap.js`
 * (19), both self-checked, both exiting non-zero on failure, both run by
 * nothing. **The gap between a suite being written and a suite being gated is
 * measured in hours here, and nobody notices from the inside** — the author ran
 * theirs by hand and it was green. Add the step in the same commit as the file.
 *
 * Their summary shapes were checked BY RUNNING THEM, not by reading the regex:
 * both print `all N <word> checks passed`, both were recognised first time, and
 * both are now pinned in `--self-check`. The check was still worth doing — the
 * previous three suites all looked fine on inspection too.
 *
 * AND AGAIN, ON THE 6-STEM BRANCH (2026-08-16). `qa/**` was invisible to this
 * file in its ENTIRETY: not one of `qa/test-edge.mjs` (32 checks),
 * `qa/passthrough-gain.mjs` (16) or `qa/live-wire.mjs`'s abort-path self-check
 * (5) had ever been run by the gate, and neither had `tools/model-parity.mjs`
 * (22) — the only thing in the tree that checks the pinned weights really do
 * carry six sources in the order `shared/config.js` claims. 75 assertions,
 * three of the four costing under a second, all of them able to see a 6-stem
 * break, none of them reachable from `node tools/verify.mjs`. They are steps
 * now.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT GATED, AND WHY — stated here rather than left as an
 * absence, because an unlisted suite is indistinguishable from a suite nobody
 * knew about, which is the whole subject of this note:
 *
 *   qa/run-qa.mjs, qa/soak.mjs, qa/probe.mjs, qa/probe-msg.mjs
 *       REPORT GENERATORS, not gates. They print notes and write JSON; they
 *       contain no PASS/FAIL assertion at all, so this runner would correctly
 *       call every one of them VOID. Making them gateable means giving them
 *       assertions, which is a change to what they ARE.
 *   tools/hop-probe.mjs, tools/mem-probe.mjs
 *       DISTRIBUTION MEASUREMENTS. `AGENTS.md`: never a median from a soak
 *       shorter than ~300 s, and hop-probe's default is 3 x 300 s. They also
 *       need an exclusive machine (see reapOrphanBrowsers() below), which a
 *       gate someone runs while working cannot promise. Shortening them to fit
 *       would produce exactly the one-phase sample the §7 rule exists to ban.
 *   tools/order-probe.mjs, tools/audible-probe.mjs
 *       Need macOS + BlackHole + ffmpeg AND change the system default output
 *       device while they run. `audible` is already here behind `--audible`;
 *       order-probe is the same rig plus a real `chrome.commands` invocation.
 *   docs/snippets/make-testbed.js --check
 *       A REAL GATE AND A REAL GAP, listed rather than added because the person
 *       who found it was registering a different suite. It is hermetic, needs no
 *       browser and no fixture, prints `all checks passed` / `N FAILED` and
 *       exits non-zero — a shape `summarise()` already knows. It only runs its
 *       assertions behind `--check`; bare, it WRITES WAV FILES, so the step is
 *       `['docs/snippets/make-testbed.js', '--check']` and getting that wrong
 *       makes a generator look like a suite. Two steps already depend on this
 *       file being right — `ground-truth` rebuilds `qa/testbed-smoke/` from it
 *       and `estimator-ground` derives its whole ground truth from it — so a
 *       break in it surfaces as a confusing red in one of those instead of a
 *       clear one here. Whoever owns `docs/snippets/` should add it.
 *   docs/snippets/bss-eval.js
 *       Takes `<truthDir> <estDir>` and exits 2 without them: it SCORES a
 *       separation that already exists on disk. Nothing in the repo produces
 *       those directories, so it is a measurement tool, not a gate. Its
 *       reference implementations ARE gated — that is what `snippets` runs.
 *   qa/live-solo.mjs (its re-scoring entry point, added 2026-08-16)
 *       `node qa/live-solo.mjs <qa/out/live-solo.json>` re-scores a RECORDED
 *       run and exits 2 with a usage line when handed no artifact, so it cannot
 *       be a standalone step. NOTE FOR classify()'s comment below, which still
 *       calls live-solo a bare module that "exits 0 and prints nothing": that
 *       stopped being true this session. The claim it stands on — that some
 *       qa/live-*.mjs are silent modules — is still true of live-boot,
 *       live-edge, live-feel and live-soak.

 * KILL ORPHANED PLAYWRIGHT CHROMIUMS BEFORE ANY TIMING RUN.
 *
 * A hung `run-ext.mjs` leaves its browser behind. The next run launches its own

 * Measured 2026-08-09: one orphan survived a hung run and silently contended
 * with every subsequent measurement for **41 minutes**, including an 11-failure
 * run that turned out to be nothing at all.
 *
 * That is the THIRD time contention has produced a false result here (two
 * parallel measuring agents; a second Chromium during the dual-deck gate; this)
 * and it is the first one with a one-line preventative. `AGENTS.md`'s rule
 * — performance measurement needs an exclusive machine — has until now been a
 * thing a human had to remember. Now the runner enforces the half it can see.
 *
 * Narrow on purpose: matches the Playwright-bundled binary path only, so a
 * user's own Chrome/Chromium is never touched.
 *
 * IT CANNOT TELL AN ORPHAN FROM A SIBLING, AND ON THIS TREE THAT MATTERS.
 * *(Added 2026-08-16, after it happened twice in one afternoon.)* Several agents
 * work this repo at once. `pkill -f ms-playwright/chromium` kills every
 * Playwright Chromium on the machine, so starting a `verify` while someone else
 * is 90 s into `qa/live-qa.mjs feel` kills THEIR browser — and what they see is
 * `page.waitForFunction: Target page, context or browser has been closed`, with
 * nothing anywhere naming the cause. Both times it cost a re-run and a wrong
 * first hypothesis.
 *
 * NOT REMOVED: the evidence for it is stronger than the evidence against. One
 * orphan silently contended for 41 minutes and produced an 11-failure run that
 * was nothing at all; a reaped sibling costs one obvious re-run. But the message
 * now says what it did in terms of the OTHER person's symptom, and `--no-reap`
 * exists for the case where you know a sibling is running. This is the
 * exclusive-machine rule (`AGENTS.md`) showing up at the process level: the

 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING IN EXACTLY ONE PLACE: `embed-build` writes
 * `out/extension-embed/` and `embed-smoke` drives it. Everything else is
 * ordered cheapest-first so a broken tree goes red in seconds.
 *
 * `slow` means "launches a browser". `heavy` (below) means "needs the 114 MB
 * weights". `--quick` drops both. There is no category for COST, and the
 * paragraph below is the standing decision not to invent one yet.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE `--quick` BUDGET — measured 2026-08-16, and the trigger for revisiting it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 68.1 s wall, 14 steps, 1284 assertions. `pitchbank` is **38.4 s of it, 56 %**.
 * It was 16.8 s on 2026-08-15 with four lanes; six lanes took it to ~31 s, and a
 * Mode-3 steady-state row, a burn-in block and three shipped-worklet mixer
 * checks took it the rest of the way. Everything else combined is 29.7 s, of
 * which `unit` is 10.2 s.
 *
 * IT IS NOT ON A DIET, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OMISSION:
 *
 *   1. NONE OF THE COST IS SLACK. The Mode-3 row is the scenario that exposed
 *      the deadline miss. The burn-in block exists because without it
 *      `cost-at-+6-leaves-half-the-quantum` goes red at 3.197 ms WITH THE CODE
 *      UNCHANGED — see the measurement trap at `pitchbank.js:186`, where the
 *      first shifter-heavy workload in a node process reads ~2.2x high (1.70 ms
 *      at 400 quanta of burn-in vs 0.77 ms at 4400) and is FLAT across all 8000
 *      timed quanta either way, so it is invisible as a trend inside a row.
 *      Cutting it buys ~10 s and buys back a flaky assertion. **A fast suite
 *      that flakes is not a faster suite** — it is the `latencySec` family
 *      again, and AGENTS.md prices that at a full investigation each time.
 *   2. THE OBVIOUS DIET IS ENTANGLED WITH (1). The candidate is the `2 decks`
 *      row's 3000 quanta. Shortening it moves the timed window relative to that
 *      same ~400-quantum warm-up ramp, so it is a change that has to be
 *      RE-MEASURED, not reasoned about — and by whoever owns the row, not by
 *      the runner.
 *   3. 68 s IS STILL THE CHEAP OPTION. `--only e2e` is ~7 min and the full run
 *      is longer again. `--quick` remains an order of magnitude cheaper for
 *      1284 assertions.
 *
 * THE TRIGGER, so this is a decision with an expiry and not a shrug: revisit if
 * `--quick` passes ~2 min, or `pitchbank` alone passes 60 s. The right move then
 * is a third category by COST — a flag that drops timing-heavy ROWS — never
 * cutting assertions, and never shortening a row that a burn-in constant is
 * tuned against without re-measuring the ramp first.
 *
 * (The five suites added on 2026-08-16 cost 4.6 s between them — `snippets` 2.8,
 * `ground-truth` 1.2, `wire-abort` 0.3, `qa-edge` 0.2, `passthrough` 0.1 — for
 * 141 assertions. None of them does any wall-clock timing, so the trap above
 * does not reach them; that was checked by grep, not assumed.)
 *
 * SUITES SIT BESIDE THE MODULE THEY COVER, not in cost order, from the moment
 * there were two per subsystem: `pitchbank` after `pitch` (it verbatim-copies
 * `pitch.js` into the worklet and asserts the copy), `keytap` after `chroma`
 * (it is chroma's only caller). A red in one is nearly always read next to the
 * other, and a summary that puts them ten lines apart makes that a scroll.

   * Beside `unit` because it is the other half of `test.js`'s `backend` group,

   * the same wrapper — over the SHIPPED `WorkerBackend` — at a fake worker PORT
   * that carries `inference.worker.js`'s own `busy` guard (is the guard ever
   * reached?). The second question needs a port with an opinion about being
   * re-entered, which a fake backend does not have.
   *
   * The failure it catches is the one three files exist to prevent and no gate

   * concurrent call leaves the session permanently unusable — not slow, DEAD,
   * for the life of the worker. It is unreachable today, so nothing observable
   * changes when the queue is deleted.
   *
   * WHICH MUTATIONS ONLY THIS STEP SEES, measured rather than assumed — the
   * first draft of this comment claimed all of them and one reviewer measured
   * otherwise, which is the AGENTS.md failure this file is meant to be immune
   * to. Running each mutation below against `node test.js` as well: mutation 1
   * also reds `unit`, because S6's own `backend` group drives the same wrapper
   * over a fake BACKEND and its two queue claims go with it. Mutations 2, 3, 4,
   * 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 leave `unit` at 612/0, so those are the ones nothing
   * else in the tree can see. Mutation 2 is the sharpest of them.
   *
   * NOT ONE OF ITS ASSERTIONS READS A CLOCK. The fake port's work is a fixed
   * number of MICROTASK TURNS, so every number it prints is a count and three
   * consecutive runs were byte-identical. ~0.1 s, no browser, no weights.
   *
   * Watched going red. THIRTEEN mutations, each applied ALONE against a green
   * 17 and reverted before the next, and between them every one of the
   * seventeen assertions has been seen to fail:
   *
   *   1. `serialiseBackend`'s queue removed (`const queued = (fn) => fn()`) —
   *      10 of 17. All four wrapped-stack claims and both seam-teardown claims;
   *      the three controls, the two mirror assertions and everything about
   *      backend #1's own teardown stay green, which is the point of having
   *      them. (`unit` 610/2 as well — see above.)
   *   2. the chain advanced with `chain = p` instead of `p.then(noop, noop)` —
   *      16 of 17, red on ONE REJECTED CALL DOES NOT WEDGE THE QUEUE, and the
   *      branch it prints is `7 of the other 15 resolved — the rejection reached
   *      calls it does not belong to`. NOT the "never settle" branch: the calls
   *      do settle, with the WRONG segment's error, and the chain stays rejected
   *      for the life of the backend so every later `separate()` on that deck
   *      fails with a stale error from a chunk it has nothing to do with. (The
   *      first draft of this comment said eight calls hang. Measured false.)
   *   3. `WorkerBackend.dispose()` back to `this.pending.clear()` with no
   *      rejection — 15 of 17: the call on the wire and an open `load()`. Both
   *      of those assertions drive the UNWRAPPED backend on purpose; through the
   *      wrapper the seam would settle the callers and this mutation would pass.
   *   4. `dispose()` rejecting but recording no `deadReason` — 15 of 17: a call
   *      arriving afterwards is told the backend "reported no reason" about a
   *      teardown that had just happened.
   *   5. the FAKE PORT's guard disabled (`if (false)`) — 15 of 17, and both reds
   *      are CONTROLS. A fake that waves a concurrent INFER through makes every
   *      "0 guard trips" below it a statement about nothing, so the suite has to
   *      fail rather than pass quietly, and it does.
   *   6. the FAKE PORT holding `busy` across its warm-up — 16 of 17: the warm-up
   *      control, which exists to show the gap the shipped guard does not cover.
   *   7. `inference.worker.js` rewording its refusal — 16 of 17: the fake's copy
   *      of that sentence has drifted off the original.
   *   8. `inference.worker.js` setting `busy` in `loadModel()` — 16 of 17: the
   *      warm-up gap would be closed, and the control that models it would be
   *      modelling a worker that no longer exists.
   *   9. a queue that SERIALISES PERFECTLY BUT DISPATCHES LIFO — 12 of 17. This
   *      is the mutation that found the defect in the FIFO assertion itself: it
   *      used to read the session's run order off `m.id`, which
   *      `WorkerBackend.separate()` mints at DISPATCH time, so the ids read
   *      1..N for any order and a strictly-backwards queue PASSED. It now reads
   *      the mix byteLength each run was handed — the caller's own stamp — and
   *      prints `23,22,…,8` here. (`unit` 610/2.)
   *  10. a queue that runs the FIRST call and quietly resolves the other 15 —
   *      11 of 17, including AT MOST ONE CALL IS ON THE WIRE, which `maxOnWire`
   *      alone could not see (a maximum is not a count) and `ran.length === N`
   *      now does. (`unit` 609/3.)
   *  11. `serialiseBackend.dispose()` not settling the calls it is holding —
   *      16 of 17: a Host backend that settles nothing leaves four callers
   *      waiting for ever. This is the seam half of the teardown contract, and
   *      it is what makes the obligation structural instead of prose on a
   *      typedef.
   *  12. the chain-front `if (disposed) throw` removed — 16 of 17: the queue
   *      drains a segment into a backend that was already given back.
   *  13. the on-the-spot refusal at the top of `queued()` removed — 16 of 17: a
   *      call made after `dispose()` queues behind an inference that will never
   *      land, which is the hang this whole section is about with a tidier
   *      cause.
   *
   * TWO MORE, WATCHED IN NEIGHBOURING FILES because that is where the assertion
   * lives: `WorkerBackend.dispose()` no longer nulling `this.probe` reds ...AND
   * A DISPOSED ONE ANSWERS WITH THE TEARDOWN (16 of 17), and the fake's
   * `ortPresent` fixture wired to a constant `true` reds its own CONTROL — the
   * control can lose. `serialiseBackend.dispose()` queued behind the chain reds
   * `unit`'s `dispose() IS NOT QUEUED` (611/1) and this step's seam-teardown
   * claim (16 of 17).

  /**
   * Beside `tree` because it crawls the same tree with the same four regexes and
   * asks the other half of the question. `tree` asks whether `extension/` loads
   * as an extension; this asks whether the engine and the deck still come OUT of
   * it — ADR 0001 decision 3's vendored unit, behind decision 4's Host seam.
   *
   * The failure it catches is invisible here by construction: a `chrome.` added
   * to a unit file works perfectly in this repository, because this repository
   * IS a Chrome extension. It costs nothing until it costs a day in a second one.
   *
   * Watched going red before it was gated, and RE-MEASURED after the review that
   * found this comment's first three numbers wrong. Each mutation applied alone,
   * against a green 67:
   *
   *   - `chrome.runtime.id` in `engine/mixer.js` — 66 of 67, one red, and the
   *     closure scan names the file and the line.
   *   - a unit file importing `../sw/service-worker.js` — 66 of 67, one red: the
   *     escape, and ONLY the escape. The partition cannot fire with it, because
   *     `crawl()` tests the declared Host paths BEFORE it descends and records
   *     an escape instead, so the file never enters the closure for the
   *     partition to see.
   *   - deleting a declared hole from `unit.json` — 60 of 63. The denominator
   *     moves because a hole carries four assertions of its own; three fire:
   *     `offscreen/host.js` now imports `host-pin.js` out of the unit, it is a
   *     closure file no ADR clause names, and its own `chrome.` is suddenly
   *     inside the unit.
   *   - `fs.readFile(new URL('../sw/service-worker.js', import.meta.url))` in
   *     `engine/mixer.js` — 66 of 67. This is the one an import-only crawl reads
   *     as green; it is why `refsOf` follows `new URL(…, import.meta.url)` too.
   *   - dropping `workers/workerbackend.js` from `roots` — 64 of 67, and the
   *     crawl-floor detail falls from 34 files to 31. Added when S6 (#8) and S9
   *     (#10) landed together: S6 made `offscreen/host.js` the only importer of
   *     `workerbackend.js`, so the crawl now stops one edge short of the entire
   *     inference implementation. Three fire — `engine/demucs.js` and both
   *     worker files leave the closure, so two ADR clauses go unmet and the
   *     partition has three files it cannot classify. This is the assertion
   *     that would have caught the integration silently mis-declaring the unit.
   *
   * S10 (#11) added the other half — the suites that verify the unit, and this
   * runner's agreement with the list. Its four mutations, each applied alone
   * against a green 75:
   *
   *   - deleting a listed suite from the tree (`qa/test-edge.mjs`) — 74 of 75,
   *     and the red names the path. This is the acceptance check for #11.
   *   - pointing a suite at a Host file (`embed-state` -> `extension/speed.js`)
   *     — 74 of 75: `speed.js` is neither in the closure nor declared outside
   *     it, so it is a content script the unit's own plan would have run.
   *   - a step id in `unit.json` that no step has (`qa-edge` -> `qa-edg`) —
   *     73 of 75, and `--self-check` goes red on the same edit. That is the
   *     silent one: `--unit` filters, and a filter cannot report a miss.
   *   - deleting an `otherSteps` entry (`svg`) — 74 of 75: a step the
   *     declaration no longer classifies, which is how a new suite quietly
   *     never joins the unit's gate.
   *
   * #11's review found four more silent greens and they are gated now, at 80.
   * Each measured on the shipped tree BEFORE the fix, then watched red after:
   *
   *   - deleting a real read (`content.js` from `speed-pitch`'s `reads`) — was
   *     75 of 75, exit 0. `reads` was declared-therefore-real only; the
   *     direction that rots was unasserted.
   *   - pointing a suite at the wrong file (`pitch` -> `engine/chroma.js`) —
   *     was 75 of 75: `--unit` runs each step's own argv, so `path` was
   *     decoration, and S11 copies these paths verbatim.
   *   - classifying a step twice (`tree` in `suites` AND `otherSteps`) — was
   *     75 of 75 and `--self-check` green, with `--unit` then running
   *     tree-check over a copy the same file says it cannot run in.
   *   - `test.js`'s `group('host')` — 122 assertions that install a Chrome
   *     platform and grade THIS Host — was undeclared, so the largest step in
   *     `--unit` read as a claim about the unit alone. It is not one.
   *
   * INTEGRATION, #9 and #11 landing in the same wave. S8's `seam` step is the
   * UNIT'S: every file `tools/seam-check.mjs` touches is unit — it drives
   * `shared/host.js`'s wrapper over `workers/workerbackend.js` and reads
   * `workers/inference.worker.js` as text — so it joined `suites`, and the
   * completeness half above confirms it opens nothing across the seam. Watched
   * from both sides on the merged tree, each edit alone:
   *
   *   - the entry missing — 79 of 80, `UNCLASSIFIED: seam`, and `--self-check`
   *     red on the same edit. That is the totality assertion #11 added doing
   *     precisely the job it was added for: a new suite landed and the gate
   *     asked which side it was on, rather than letting `--unit` never run it.
   *   - the entry pointing at the wrong file (`seam` -> `tools/tree-check.mjs`)
   *     — 78 of 80, `NOT WHAT THE STEP RUNS: seam runs tools/seam-check.mjs`.
   *
   * The four round-1 numbers above were measured against a green 75 and read
   * one lower against today's 80: #11's acceptance check, re-run on the merged
   * tree, is 79 of 80 naming `qa/test-edge.mjs`.
