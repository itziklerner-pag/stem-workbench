/**
 * Runnable checks for the non-trivial DSP. No browser, no framework, no deps.
 *
 *   node test.js            # everything
 *   node test.js fft ring   # just those groups
 *
 * What is covered and why (CONTRIBUTING.md: "non-trivial logic leaves one runnable
 * check behind"):
 *
 * THE GROUP NAMES BELOW ARE THE ONES `group()` ACTUALLY TESTS. Three names that
 * were listed here for months — `ola`, `sum`, `wav` — belonged to no group at
 * all, so `node test.js ola wav` printed `0 passed, 0 failed` and exited 0:
 * `tools/verify.mjs`'s VOID rule calls that a hard failure for a suite, and a
 * header that lies about its filters is how a run ends up asserting nothing
 * while reporting success. Keep this list and `if (group('…'))` in step.
 *
 *   window   the export window is upstream Demucs' triangular transition weight,
 *            AND THE WAV BYTE MAP: encodeWav/decodeWav round-trip at 32f, 24-bit
 *            and 16-bit, the header field offsets, and the sample-conversion loop
 *            that every writer in shared/wav.js shares — which is what makes this
 *            group the coverage the wavstream group's mutation note defers to
 *   wavstream  U1's streaming WAV writers: the chunked and the unknown-length
 *            OPFS writer emit exactly the bytes encodeWav emits, the header is
 *            final before any audio is written, and a wrong frame count throws
 *   fft      rfft agrees with a naive DFT; STFT/iSTFT round-trips
 *   ring     the SAB capture ring is lossless across wrap
 *   live     Mode 1: the causal chunk plan emits every sample exactly once, the
 *            crossfade reconstructs an identity model exactly, all twelve stem
 *            planes are sample-aligned, the stem ring accounts for under- and
 *            overruns under a simulated slow producer, and neither a stop
 *            mid-inference nor an L3 demotion leaves a scratch buffer detached
 *   cache    the prime-then-play stem cache: keys, eviction, refusals, resume
 *   mix      fader law round trip, mute/solo truth table, per-sample gain
 *            smoothing settle time, soft clipper transfer function
 *   xf       the crossfader: curves, targets, and the per-stem assignment
 *   sched    Mode 3's L3 policy: who gives up the GPU, and who never does
 *   dual     two decks on one GPU, end to end against a simulated clock
 *   backend  the inference seam (S6): the serialising wrapper lets one
 *            load()/separate() reach a backend at a time, in call order, and
 *            the deck builds its own backend through it
 *   verifyModel  the model pin the UNIT keeps (S7): a mismatching buffer is
 *            refused naming both hashes, a truncated one naming both byte
 *            counts, the load policy re-fetches a corrupt stored copy exactly
 *            once and never twice, and nothing under extension/ names the
 *            model's upstream host except the extension host's own pin
 *   host     the Host seam, both halves. The boot check names a missing duty
 *            and refuses a Host that is short one, the engine really runs it
 *            before it builds anything, R5's track-stop survives every failing
 *            path, and each shipped Host — offscreen/host.js, ui/host.js — is
 *            driven through the duties the typedef spells MUST: the envelope,
 *            late binding, the address filter, the MV3 response channel, the
 *            capture token, and the swallowed delivery failure
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * RENDERING vs REACHABILITY — read this before trusting an assertion here.
 *
 * A test that CONSTRUCTS the state it is testing cannot prove the production
 * path ever reaches that state. We nearly shipped `phase` with pushState()
 * rendering it perfectly and nothing assigning it: the unit test set `lp.phase`
 * by hand, so the field was null for the entire priming window and only the
 * browser caught it.
 *
 * Five groups below are rendering-only. Each is marked `RENDERING ONLY` at the
 * head, says what it cannot see, and names what covers reachability:
 *
 *   1. gain smoothing (`mix`)     reimplements the worklet's one-pole loop.
 *        reached by: run-ext.mjs measures 18.0 ms mute-to-silence in the
 *        rendered samples.
 *   2. QA-15 summing (`mix`)      reimplements the worklet's summing line.
 *        reached by: run-ext.mjs "output is EXACTLY zero for the whole kill".
 *   3. soft clip (`mix`)          `applyCurve` reimplements WaveShaper.
 *        reached by: run-ext.mjs reads `oversample` and the curve length off
 *        the live graph (4x is mandatory, AUDIO.md §4.3).
 *   4. ladder simulation (`live`) reimplements pump()'s loop, though the
 *        DECISION it drives is the real `skipFrames`.
 *        reached by: run-ext.mjs DEV_FORCE_DROP and the hop-1.0 soak.
 *   5. SAB ring producer (`ring`, `live`) mirrors capture-processor.js, which
 *        cannot be imported outside an AudioWorklet.
 *        reached by: run-ext.mjs "SAB ring filled from the AudioWorklet".
 *
 * Everything else drives production code directly and is reachable by
 * construction. When you add a test, say which kind it is.

/**
 * A THROW INSIDE A BLOCK IS A DEAD FILE, AND A DEAD FILE IS WORSE THAN A RED.
 *
 * This file is ONE process: a block that throws ends the run, so every later
 * block's verdict is lost and the summary line never prints. That is the exact
 * shape of upstream #30 — a suite whose ability to REPORT a defect was itself
 * destroyed by the defect — and it has now appeared three times in the cache
 * group alone: `CacheWriter.stems()` throwing on a frames/audio disagreement,
 * a block reaching for a file a broken `put()` never wrote, and this suite's
 * own apparatus doing the same.
 *
 * `stemcache.js` already does LAYER 1: it NAMES the failure instead of letting
 * a `RangeError` escape from inside `Float32Array.set`. This is LAYER 2, and it
 * belongs at the CALLER, because only the caller knows which block died.
 *
 * LAYER 1 SAYS WHAT WENT WRONG; LAYER 2 SAYS WHAT IT COST. Neither is the other's
 * substitute. A named throw with no guard is a good message on a dead file; a
 * guard with no naming is a live file reporting that something unspecified
 * happened. Read together they give the whole account in one red line — the
 * thrown sentence, the block it killed, and the assertions that never ran.
 *
 * ITS BOUND, MEASURED AND STATED: it converts a crash into a report. It does
 * NOT recover the assertions after the throw — those did not run, are not
 * counted, and the red says so in those words. A block that throws is still a
 * failure; it is now a failure you can read the rest of the file around.

/**
 * A MINIMAL IN-MEMORY OPFS, AND THE ONLY ONE IN THIS FILE. Seeded by U0 (#33)
 * for the two-instance isolation gate and extended by U10 (#34) for the rest of
 * `StemCache`. One implementation, because two would be two chances to be
 * wrong about the same platform.
 *
 * Only the calls `shared/stemcache.js` actually makes are implemented, and the
 * TWO REJECTIONS ARE LOAD-BEARING: `getFileHandle` on a missing file and
 * `removeEntry` on a missing entry must THROW, because those are exactly what
 * `readJson()`, `get()`, `clear()` and `delete()` catch. A shim that resolved
 * them would let a whole block pass against a cache that never stored anything
 * — the VOID failure one level down.
 *
 * `navigator` IS A CONFIGURABLE GETTER WITH NO SETTER in Node 22, so a plain
 * `globalThis.navigator = {...}` silently does nothing and leaves
 * `navigator.storage` undefined. Measured, not assumed. `defineProperty` is the
 * only thing that takes, and `restore()` puts the original descriptor back.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SHIM AT `navigator.storage` AND NOT A `dir()` SEAM — read this
 * before "simplifying" it into one, because a seam is smaller and worse:
 *
 *  1. IT RUNS THE SHIPPED PATH. `dir()`, `readJson()`, `writeFile()`,
 *     `loadManifest()` and the order `put()` writes in are all production code
 *     under every assertion above. A `dir()` seam lets the tests agree with the
 *     seam while the real `dir()` drifts — which is the exact failure these
 *     suites exist to catch, so building the instrument out of it would be
 *     circular.
 *  2. THE SEAM WOULD SIT ON MOVING LINES. `dir()` had just become
 *     instance-scoped for the 32f tier (U0, #33) — a seam threaded through it
 *     would have had to be re-cut by that change, and an instrument that is
 *     re-cut every time its anchor moves is one that will eventually be cut
 *     wrong and go on passing.
 *
 * The apparatus beyond a plain filesystem is deliberate and named:
 *   `written`  every file name in the order its bytes LANDED, which is how the
 *              "manifest is written last" claim is checked rather than believed.
 *   `failOn`   file names whose next close() throws, to interrupt a put mid-way
 *              and see what a crash leaves behind.

 * WATCHED RED BY MUTATION — all eighteen. Each mutation below was applied to a
 * green tree, `node test.js wavstream` was run, the red was read, and the file
 * was restored. AGENTS.md:118: "an assertion never observed failing is one whose
 * ability to fail is an assumption."
 *
 * THE BATTERY IS `qa/mutations-u1-wavstream.mjs`, AND THIS TABLE IS ITS OUTPUT.
 * Re-run it rather than believing this comment. A mutation anchors on a span of
 * source, and a later slice that rewrites that span decays the anchor SILENTLY —
 * a search that matches nothing reads exactly like one that matched and passed.
 * Two other Phase 4 batteries decayed that way with neither author knowing; this
 * one had no file at all until it was re-run and checked in, so its only record
 * was this table, and a table cannot re-measure itself.
 *
 *     node qa/mutations-u1-wavstream.mjs               the fifteen, with a control
 *     node qa/mutations-u1-wavstream.mjs --list        do the anchors still match?
 *     node qa/mutations-u1-wavstream.mjs --self-check  can the battery say MUTE?
 *
 * PROVENANCE, because a mutation is only evidence about the source it was cut
 * for. M1-M12 were cut against 1040de1 and M13-M15 against 0fb693a — both landed
 * commits, so both stamps stay resolvable. RE-ESTABLISHED against main 5993d32:
 * 15 of 15 anchors still matching, 15 of 15 reddening EXACTLY the assertions
 * named here and nothing else, and all 18 assertions covered by at least one
 * mutation. Nothing needed re-cutting because wav.js is untouched between
 * 0fb693a and 5993d32. The `wav.js:NNN` coordinates below are as of 5993d32 and
 * are the first thing that will go stale; the anchor TEXT in the battery is what
 * is authoritative, and `--list` prints the current line for each.
 *
 * THE MUTATIONS TARGET THE COMPOSITION, NOT THE SAMPLE LOOP, and that is not an
 * oversight. `writeFrames` is shared by all three writers, so breaking it moves
 * both sides of a byte-identity assertion equally and the assertion stays green
 * — which is the honest cost of the streaming path being the SAME encoder rather
 * than a second one. What these assertions can see is everything built around
 * that loop: the header, the chunk boundaries, the pad byte, the frame
 * accounting and the two refusals. The existing group('window') covers the loop
 * itself against the byte map, and M15 below is where that transitive coverage
 * is observed rather than assumed.
 *

 * M13-M15 CLOSE A COVERAGE HOLE AN ADVERSARIAL REVIEW FOUND, and M13 is the

 * write, and the cache writes 16-bit (stemcache.js put()). `fact` is present only
 * for float, so every patch offset past the fmt chunk differs between the two
 * formats, and 32f stereo blockAlign 8 is always even so close()'s pad byte was
 * unreachable as well.
 *
 *   M13 wav.js:78   dataSizeAt is wrong for PCM ONLY, float left untouched:
 *                   `fmt.headerSize - 4 + (fmt.factSize ? 0 : 2)`
 *                   -> 2 red: the 16-bit sync round trip, the odd-payload pad.
 *                   BEFORE these two assertions existed this mutation left the
 *                   whole group green while every 16-bit and 24-bit cache file
 *                   carried a data-chunk size of zero.
 *   M14 wav.js:379  close() never writes the pad byte for an odd payload
 *                   -> 1 red: the odd-payload pad
 *   M15 wav.js:134  the float path clamps to ±1.0 like the fixed-point paths
 *                   -> 1 red here (the streamed out-of-range read-back), and 2
 *                   more in group('window') — `32f round trip is bit exact` and
 *                   `32f preserves out-of-range samples`, both re-measured at
 *                   5993d32 with `node test.js window`. That is the transitive
 *                   coverage the note above describes, observed rather than
 *                   assumed, and it is the assertion that would go missing if a
 *                   future writer were given its own conversion loop.

     *   output.busPeak 0 · terminalIsDestination true · ctx.state "running"
     *   outputAlarm NULL  <- the engine said nothing for 2416 seconds
     *
     * The tab was PAUSED. The pipeline was correct end to end and was faithfully
     * separating silence into silence. `OUTPUT_SILENT` could not fire because it
     * demands `meters.peak.master > 1e-3` BEFORE it will count a silent tick,
     * and `OUTPUT_STALLED` could not fire because the worklet was heartbeating
     * 33 ms ago. The one instrument named for this failure was structurally
     * incapable of seeing it.
     *
     * This is why the deleted end-to-end block is not needed: it rested on an
     * unverified premise about what the model emits for an all-zero input, and
     * this rests on what the product actually did on a user's machine.
     *
     * ---- THE PASTE IS FOUR-STEM. READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE REPLAY.
     *
     * That run predates guitar and piano — `worklet.gain [1,1,1,1,1,1]` is four
     * stems plus passthrough plus master, i.e. the OLD six-slot map, not the
     * eight-slot one this branch ships. The transcription above is left exactly
     * as it was pasted; what is widened is the REPLAY, and only on the clause
     * that the run's own premise settles: THE TAB WAS PAUSED, so the capture
     * ring was digital zero and the separator was faithfully turning silence
     * into silence. That is a property of the INPUT, so it holds for every stem
     * the model emits, at any stem count — `guitar: 0` and `piano: 0` are
     * entailed by `capture.peak [0, 0]`, not invented to make six keys.
     *
     * What is NOT claimed: nothing here is evidence about how guitar and piano
     * behave on a run with audio in it. That needs a new measurement, and
     * SIX-STEM-CONTRACT §4 records that we do not have one yet.

   * ms-blocks, 0 drops. Fired 4/4 at hop 1.0 and 0/2 at hop 1.95 with a **0.2 s
   * margin**, on a build nobody had changed.
   *
   *   D1 — THE HOLD WAS A STOPWATCH. `deadTicks >= 3 s * HEALTH_HZ` counts
   *        `setInterval` callbacks and starts at `play()`, so it spent its whole
   *        budget on the deck's own start-up: the deck was faithfully replaying
   *        the silence the tab produced before the user pressed play.
   *   D2 — IT COMPARED TWO CLOCKS. `inputPeak` came from `ring.peaks()` (the
   *        CAPTURE clock, "now") and `meters` is the speaker, `latencySec`
   *        behind. When the tab woke mid-count the verdict flipped
   *        `dead-input -> dead-mixer` with nothing in the mixer changing — and
   *        the console picks the REMEDY off that variant, so the user was told to
   *        restart a working deck instead of to press play in their own tab.
   *
   * The fix is a count and a clock, not a bigger constant: raising the hold would
   * have made this red go away while leaving the gate measuring the machine, and
   * it would have lengthened the forty-minute defect the arm exists to catch.

  /**
   * cache — A FILE SOURCE IS KEYED BY WHAT IT IS, NOT BY WHAT IT IS CALLED.
   *
   * REACHABLE: drives the real `fileIdFromBytes`, `fileIdentity`, `fileRefusal`
   * and `fileCommitRefusal` in `shared/stemcache.js`. Pure functions over a
   * platform digest — no OPFS, no clock, no model, no fixture longer than it
   * needs to be.
   *
   * WHY IT EXISTS. `videoIdFromUrl` returns null for anything that is not a
   * YouTube page, and `cacheKey(null, hop)` is the literal key
   * `'null--<pipelineVersion>'` — ONE key shared by every file the user ever
   * opens. The CONTROL assertion below produces that collision rather than
   * describing it, so what the assertions around it protect is on the record.
   *
   * TODAY'S TREE DOES NOT REACH THAT KEY: `trackKey()` (`offscreen/engine.js:
   * 547-551`) has `if (!videoId) return null` and caches nothing. That guard is
   * right for a YouTube tab off a video page and wrong for a file, where the
   * videoId is ALWAYS absent — reusing it means the ahead-of-time tier never
   * fills. Collide-everything and cache-nothing are the two answers a shared
   * identity gives a File source, and neither is a cache; hence a separate one.
   *
   * MUTATION LOG — every assertion in both blocks watched red, each mutation
   * applied ALONE to a green tree, `node test.js cache` run and read before the
   * file was restored. Line numbers are `extension/shared/stemcache.js` at this
   * commit; `reds` counts FAIL lines. Every assertion this slice adds is covered
   * by at least one row.

     * THE WORST-CASE SUM, RE-DERIVED AT SIX STEMS — AND A FINDING ABOUT WHAT
     * THIS ASSERTION CAN AND CANNOT SEE. Read this before citing it as headroom
     * evidence for the six-stem move.
     *
     * The arithmetic: every stem fader hard at the top is +6 dB = x1.9953, so
     * `STEMS.length` identical stems summed is 6 x 2 = 12.0 linear, where four
     * stems gave 8.0. That IS more summed energy and the number in the assertion
     * moves with it.
     *
     * The physics: it changes NOTHING, and pretending otherwise would be the
     * wrong estimator for the claim (AGENTS.md). `applyCurve` reproduces
     * WaveShaper, which CLAMPS its input to ±1 after the 1/headroom divide — so
     * every input at or above `headroom` (2.0) maps to the same last curve
     * sample. Measured: applyCurve(8, 2) and applyCurve(12, 2) are the identical
     * 0.99992, and so is applyCurve(2, 2). The four-stem form was already
     * saturated: at four stems, at six, at sixty, this returns the ceiling.
     *
     * So it stays green at six stems, and it stays green for a reason that has
     * nothing to do with stem count. IT IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT SIX STEMS IS
     * HEADROOM-SAFE. The clipper cannot let the DAC clip at any input; what six
     * stems changes is how much of the time the clipper is WORKING, which is a
     * measurement (`tools/mashup-probe.mjs`) and is SIX-STEM-CONTRACT §"known
     * debt" item 2 — `DUAL_MASTER_TRIM_DB = -3` was measured with four stems and
     * has not been re-measured. Do not close that item on the strength of this
     * line.
     *
     * Split into arithmetic and physics so the two claims cannot hide behind
     * each other, and the saturation is asserted explicitly rather than left as
     * the silent reason a `<= 1.0` gate passes.

   * `docs/VENDORING.md` sends a second Host here: swap the two holes for your
   * own files, run `node tools/verify.mjs --unit`, and read the reds. That only
   * works if the group can RUN to its end. A hole module that throws at MODULE
   * EVALUATION — the natural shape for a Host whose platform bridge lives on
   * `window` or in a preload — used to take the whole process out at the import
   * line: the first real second Host died here after 482 assertions and got a
   * stack trace where the report should have been. A crash is strictly worse
   * than a red. A red says "your `storageGet` is wrong"; a crash says nothing at
   * all and reads as a broken vendored copy.
   *
   * So the body below is wrapped, and it is wrapped in TWO places for two
   * different failures:
   *
   *   1. `importHole()` — an evaluation-time throw becomes ONE named red that
   *      names the hole's path and what it threw. That is the failure the rule
   *      "a hole must import inertly" exists to catch, and naming the file is
   *      the whole repair instruction.
   *   2. this `try` — a hole that imports fine and then throws on its FIRST DUTY
   *      CALL, or any other throw between here and the last assertion, becomes
   *      the named red at the foot of the group instead of ending the run. The
   *      three groups after this one, and the two checks at the foot of the
   *      file, still report.
   *
   * THIS IS A REPORTING IMPROVEMENT AND NOT A COMPLETENESS GUARANTEE. Anyone
   * adopting this shape elsewhere needs that distinction, because the failure it
   * invites is subtler than the one it fixes: the guard buys a named cause and a
   * summary, and it does NOT recover the assertions after the throw. Measured on
   * the mutation it was watched red against — a `ui/host.js` that reads its
   * preload bridge at module scope — `node test.js` goes from 766 passed to
   * 680 passed / 2 failed. EIGHTY-FOUR ASSERTIONS DID NOT RUN. A guarded suite
   * that went red must not be read as fully covered. (Re-measured at v0.3.0,
   * `b9dc537`; it was 622 -> 529 with ninety-one not run when first written,
   * and the truncation moved by a different amount than the totals did.)
   *
   * WHAT MAKES THAT TRUNCATION VISIBLE, rather than merely absent, is a gate
   * that already existed: `tools/verify.mjs`'s coverage diff prints
   * `no longer runs: <assertion name>` for every assertion that stopped
   * executing, under the warning "An ABSENT assertion reads as green. N/N is
   * only comparable between runs when N is." The guard's job is to make sure
   * there is a completed run for that diff to compare against at all — before
   * it, the process died and the runner reported `RED — 0 failing assertions`,
   * which names nothing and reads like a broken vendored copy. The count in this
   * group's own detail line is the other half: it says how much did not run.
   *
   * THE BODY IS DELIBERATELY NOT RE-INDENTED under this `try`. It is ~2800 lines
   * and 122 assertions; re-indenting them would bury a four-line change in a
   * whole-file diff and take the blame history with it.
   *
   * The two globals restored in the `finally` are the deck half's: `window` is
   * installed BEFORE `ui/host.js` is imported (that is the point of it) and
   * `chrome` is re-stubbed per block. The engine half restores its own three in
   * its own `finally`, further down, which a throw here cannot skip.

  /**
   * WHAT THIS COVERS AND WHY IT IS WORTH A GATE.
   *
   * `extension/shared/host.js` declares what the unit asks of whatever is
   * hosting it, and `assertHost()` refuses a Host that is short a duty at MODULE
   * EVALUATION. The moment matters: without it, a Host missing `captureStream`
   * surfaces as `host.captureStream is not a function` thrown from inside
   * `captureStart`, which is precisely the halfway R5 is about — a capture that
   * fails after the track exists and leaves the user's tab silent.
   *
   * WHICH KIND OF TEST THIS IS — the RENDERING vs REACHABILITY rule at the head
   * of this file. NOT rendering-only, and in three separate ways, because
   * driving `assertHost()` with hand-built stubs and stopping there would be:
   *
   *   1. The shipping Host is DRIVEN, never imitated.
   *      `extension/offscreen/host.js` — the module `offscreen/engine.js`
   *      imports and the only EngineHost that ships — goes through the real
   *      `assertHost`, and further down every one of the duties it declares
   *      is CALLED with the platform stubbed underneath it. Deleting a duty
   *      from that file, or changing what one returns, turns this group red. It is also the CONTROL
   *      for the refusals below: without it, "a broken Host is refused" would be
   *      satisfied by a function that refuses everything.
   *   2. The CALL SITE is read out of `engine.js`. `assertHost` working proves
   *      nothing about the engine ever calling it — review proved exactly that,
   *      by deleting the module-scope call and watching the whole tree stay
   *      green while two assertion names went on claiming it as their entry
   *      point.
   *   3. The stubs exist only to break ONE declared duty at a time, which is the
   *      one thing a real Host cannot be asked to do on demand.
   *

   * at branch time expires the moment another slice edits the file it patched
   * and nothing announces that (`INTEGRATION.md` §18). Re-run them:
   *
   *     node tools/mutations/u8-seam-fixes.mjs M1 M2 M3 M4
   *
   * ANCHORS CUT AGAINST `5993d32`. That file reports two answers per case and
   * not one — whether the ANCHOR still matches, and whether the mutation still
   * REDS — because a battery that reports a single pass count is how ten dead
   * anchors once read as 44 of 51 rather than as ten instruments pointing at
   * nothing.
   *
   * THE `made at` COLUMN NAMES THE ANCHOR TEXT, NOT A LINE NUMBER, on purpose:
   * a line number is the first thing to decay and the battery patches text.
   *
   *   #    mutation                                          | made at                       | red here, and the control

   * reads exactly like one that passed if you only look at the red lines, which
   * is why the battery checks every control as a PASS rather than as "absent

   * `no longer runs:` for each one.

   * existing Host fails at boot. That is precisely what lets a duty be DECLARED
   * in one tag and CONSUMED in the next: a second product implements it against

   *
   * SO THE EXEMPTION IS EXACT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, and that is what keeps it from
   * becoming the "expected red" list AGENTS.md forbids:
   *   - a duty that is unreached and NOT named below is a red, unchanged;
   *   - a duty named below that IS reached is ALSO a red, so the slice that
   *     writes the caller has to delete its line in the same commit. An
   *     exemption that outlives its reason is the thing that rots;
   *   - a name below that is in no duty table is a red too, so a duty that gets
   *     renamed or removed cannot leave a permanent hole behind it.

   * R5 — TRACK-STOP DISCIPLINE, ASSERTED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
   *
   * `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` R5: holding the MediaStream track IS the tab mute.
   * Chrome mutes a tab the moment it is captured and releasing the track
   * unmutes it, so a capture that fails after the stream exists — and does not
   * stop it — leaves the user's tab permanently silent with no affordance to
   * fix it. `SECURITY.md` puts that in scope as a vulnerability.
   *
   * It had no assertion anywhere before this slice, and the slice is exactly
   * the edit most likely to break it: the token now crosses a Host boundary
   * (`host.captureStream`), so the tempting mistake is a null check, a log line
   * or an early return between the stream arriving and the guard that stops it.
   *
   * READ OUT OF THE BUILD rather than reimplemented, the same shape
   * `qa/speed-pitch.mjs` uses to read the key-lock policy out of `content.js`
   * and `qa/passthrough-gain.mjs` uses to read `pushGains` out of `live.js`.
   * `captureStart` cannot be driven from Node — `offscreen/engine.js` builds an
   * AudioContext, a Worker and a MasterBus at module scope — so the claim is
   * made where it is checkable. FAILS IF IT CANNOT LOOK: a `captureStart` this
   * cannot locate, or a second `host.captureStream` call it did not expect, is
   * a red rather than a silent pass.

   *
   * THE PLATFORM IS STUBBED, NEVER THE HOST — the same rule the engine half
   * states. `chrome` goes on `globalThis` at the point of use; `window` has to
   * go on before the import, because `ui/host.js` reads `window.parent` and
   * hangs its one `message` listener at MODULE SCOPE. That is deliberate on
   * both sides: the module asks `window.parent` rather than a bare `parent`
   * precisely so it can be driven from here, and the frame question is
   * evaluated once, at import, which is what makes the two-import test below
   * mean anything.
   *
   * `posted` is the outgoing postMessage wire and `listeners` the incoming one.
   * A LONE window is one whose `parent` is itself — a document opened outside a
   * frame, where a post to `parent` lands back on its own listener.
   *
   * WHICH WINDOW IT WENT TO IS TAGGED, and that tag is the whole difference
   * between an assertion and a name. Both sinks land in the same `posted` array,
   * so without `to` a Host that posted to its OWN window instead of its parent —
   * every deck -> host message reaching `content.js` never — is indistinguishable
   * from a correct one. Review measured exactly that: `window.postMessage(msg,
   * '*')` in place of `window.parent.postMessage` left `node test.js host` at
   * 58 passed, 0 failed, under an assertion whose name says "to `parent`".
   * On a LONE window `parent` IS the window, so `to: 'self'` there is the truth

     *     assertion saying so`.
     *   - The DUTY-LIST half — `DECK_HOST_DUTIES` declaring a `storage` entry in
     *     place of the three flat duties. Watched: the shipped `ui/host.js` is
     *     then short a duty and the group dies at `assertHost` before reaching
     *     this line, which is a louder red than this one and not a substitute
     *     for it.
     *
     * WHAT DOES NOT REACH IT: widening the CALLABILITY test alone, e.g. to
     * `host[k] == null`. That is caught by the two not-callable checks above and
     * NOT here, because the three flat duties are `undefined` in this fixture and

   * did not go through the seam at all: the master meter worklet (`master.js`),
   * the playback worklet twice over (`live.js` and `cacheddeck.js`, once per
   * kind of deck), and the ORT runtime directory plus its presence probe
   * (`deck.js`) each called `chrome.runtime.getURL` themselves. A second Host
   * could therefore implement all five duties perfectly and still not load a
   * single worklet — and neither `assertHost` nor the interface-drift pair above
   * can see that, because both only ever look at `engine.js`.
   *
   * REACHABLE, NOT CONSTRUCTED — and the fact that it CAN be reachable is itself
   * the result this slice is after. All four files now import and run under Node
   * with no `chrome` global in existence, so every claim below drives the
   * shipped graph builder and reads back what it asked the Host for. The same
   * code before this slice threw `chrome is not defined` on the first line of
   * each of the five sites.
   *
   * WHAT IS STUBBED IS THE PLATFORM, NEVER THE GRAPH. `addModule` records the
   * URL it is handed and resolves; construction then dies at the first real Web
   * Audio node, which Node does not have. That is deliberate rather than
   * tolerated: the claim is about what the builder asked the Host for, and
   * everything after `addModule` is the browser gate's job
   * (`tools/embed-smoke.mjs`).
   *
   * THE RESOLVER IS A STUB WITH A SCHEME NOTHING ELSE USES (`stub://unit/`), so

   * second copy of the path — cannot be mistaken for one that came from the Host.

    /**
     * THE ORIGIN OF THE THREAD — the one claim the ten above cannot make, and
     * the one the slice is actually named after.
     *
     * Each of those ten hands the builder a `stub://unit/` resolver written in
     * this file. Together they prove the four files USE a resolver; not one of
     * them proves that `offscreen/engine.js` SUPPLIES one. Review measured the
     * hole exactly: delete the single line `assetUrl: host.assetUrl` from the
     * `shared` bundle and `--quick` stays GREEN at 18 of 20 steps and
     * `embed-smoke` stays at 122/122, while the shipped extension dies at
     * module evaluation — `engine.js` calls `decks.A.ensureBackend()` at module
     * scope and it throws `this.s.assetUrl is not a function`. No INIT, no
     * HELLO, no engine, and nothing red anywhere. That is the exact shape
     * AGENTS.md names as the source of five defects here: a value right at four
     * call sites and absent at the one that feeds them.
     *
     * TWO GATES NOW, BECAUSE CI IS ONLY ONE OF THEM. `Deck` and `CachedDeck`
     * refuse a bundle short the resolver (below), which turns that mutation
     * into a module-scope throw — and a module-scope throw takes `embed-smoke`
     * to `5/37 FAILED`. This pair is what makes `--quick`, the only gate
     * GitHub Actions runs, see it too.
     *
     * READ AS TEXT for the reason the block at the top of this group gives:
     * `engine.js` cannot be imported from Node at all. Comments are stripped —
     * which matters here more than usual, because the doc comment sitting

   * enforced by code that also owned `MODEL.url`, so the whole download lived on
   * the unit's side of the seam, and `fetch` plus the Cache API are not
   * `chrome.*`: the S9 unit gate, a grep for `chrome.`, is structurally
   * incapable of seeing a network path shaped like that one. S7 moved the URL to

   * WHICH KIND OF TEST THIS IS — the RENDERING vs REACHABILITY rule at the head
   * of this file. Reachable by construction, in both halves:
   *
   *   1. `verifyModel` is the SHIPPED function, driven over buffers that are
   *      actually built here rather than described. The pin is a PARAMETER for
   *      exactly this reason — hard-coding the real SHA-256 beside a fabricated
   *      buffer would put a second copy of the pin in this file, which is what
   *      `shared/config.js` exists to prevent. The parametrised pin is computed
   *      from the bytes by the same primitive the function uses, so a control is
   *      needed and there is one: the DEFAULT pin is the shipped one, and the
   *      same bytes fail against it.
   *   2. `loadModel` is the SHIPPED policy, driven over a fake Host whose only
   *      job is to hand over bytes and count how often it was asked. Every claim
   *      about the retry is a COUNT — `modelBytes` calls, `clearModel` calls —
   *      never a clock and never a timeout.
   *
   * The Host's side of the same seam is the `host` group above: that the bytes
   * come from `offscreen/host.js`, and that it never judges them. Neither group
   * alone says the split holds; together they do.

   *
   * WHICH KIND OF TEST THIS IS — the RENDERING vs REACHABILITY rule at the head
   * of this file. Reachable by construction on the mechanism, rendering-only on
   * the consequence, and the split is deliberate:
   *   - the SHIPPED `serialiseBackend` is driven. Nothing below reimplements the
   *     queue, so deleting it turns this group red.
   *   - the BACKEND is fake, because the thing being asserted is that the
   *     wrapper never lets a second call reach it, and a real ORT session cannot
   *     be asked to report that: its answer to being re-entered is to wedge and
   *     stop answering anything. The fake COUNTS instead.
   *   - reached by: `offscreen/deck.js` `ensureBackend()` is the only caller of
   *     `serialiseBackend` in the tree, asserted below by reading it, and S8
   *     (#9) drives the same wrapper over a fake worker port that throws on
   *     INFER-while-busy the way the real one does.
   *
   * NOT ONE ASSERTION HERE READS A CLOCK. Every claim is a count: how many calls
   * were inside the backend at once, in what order they arrived, how many

   * A port is exactly where behaviour goes missing quietly, and none of the
   * three had an assertion on either side of the move.
   *
   *   1. EVERY PENDING CALL REJECTS. Review finding M1: a failure that does not
   *      arrive as `{type:'ERROR'}` — a module load failure, an uncaught
   *      rejection, an OOM that kills the worker — leaves entries nothing will
   *      ever settle, and `await separate(...)` then hangs for ever with no
   *      cancel path. Nothing times it out; nothing else would notice.
   *   2. THE NEXT `separate()` REFUSES WITH THE RECORDED REASON, and does not
   *      spawn a replacement. A worker that cannot resolve its imports dies
   *      identically every time, so one per chunk is what re-spawning here
   *      buys — and the failure ladder never sees a stable error to halt on.
   *   3. `load()` DOES REPLACE IT. That is the pre-seam asymmetry:
   *      `ensureSession()` called `ensureWorker()` (which spawned) and `infer()`
   *      called `requireWorker()` (which refused), so a worker killed for memory
   *      cost the user one gesture rather than a reload. `load()` is once per
   *      gesture; `separate()` is once per 1.95 s.
   *
   * The SHIPPED `WorkerBackend` is driven over a stubbed `Worker` and `fetch`.
   * The stub is the only thing a browser would have supplied — there is no fake
   * backend here, which is the point: this block is about the real one.
