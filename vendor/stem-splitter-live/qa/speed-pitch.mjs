/**
 * SPEED MUST NOT MOVE THE KEY — the acceptance gate for the 2026-08-17 ruling.
 *
 *     node qa/speed-pitch.mjs
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT BROKE. The build shipped VARISPEED: `content.js::driveRate()` — the one
 * driver of `video.playbackRate` — wrote `preservesPitch = false` before every
 * rate, so the page's own player transposed by the rate and the capture tap,
 * which sits downstream of it, recorded the transposed audio. Every stem the
 * separator produced was therefore already in the wrong key, and TRANSPOSE was
 * the operator's manual undo. It was deliberate, it was documented, and the spec
 * has overruled it: **speed changes the tempo and nothing else, matching what
 * YouTube's own speed menu does, because that is what every player the user has
 * ever touched does.**
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT SEE, said first so no assertion below is read as
 * more than it is.
 *
 * The rate stage is CHROME'S — `media::AudioRendererAlgorithm` behind
 * `HTMLMediaElement.preservesPitch` — and there is no Chrome in Node. So the
 * chain that decides the deck's output pitch is split in two and this file
 * handles the halves differently:
 *
 *   1. WHICH BRANCH THE SHIPPED BUILD SELECTS. Read out of the shipped sources,
 *      not restated here — §1. This is the half that broke and it is the half
 *      the assertions can move.
 *   2. WHAT EACH BRANCH DOES. Defined by the HTML spec: `preservesPitch = true`
 *      leaves the pitch alone, `false` makes it follow the rate. §2 turns that
 *      into ONE number, `uaRatio`, and drives a REAL windowed-sinc resampler
 *      with it — so the varispeed branch really is a resampled signal whose
 *      fundamental has really moved, and the estimator really has to find it.
 *   3. EVERYTHING AFTER THE TAP — the ring, the segmenter, the overlap-add, the
 *      pitch lanes. Only the last of those can move a pitch, and it is the real
 *      `extension/engine/pitch.js`, driven here at the same settings the deck
 *      bus drives it at.
 *
 * So: `f_out = F0 · uaRatio(rate, keyLock) · 2^(transpose/12)`, and the ruling
 * is the claim that the middle factor is 1.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY NOT COMPENSATE IN THE ENGINE, since `pitch.js` is already on the bus. §4
 * computes it rather than arguing it. Short version: the compensation is
 * −12·log2(rate), `pitch.js` produces INTEGER semitones in [−6, +6], and of the
 * deck's 29 rungs only 13 land on one. The ladder's own ends need ±12 — twice
 * the whole range — composition with TRANSPOSE overflows before the range does,
 * and above 1x varispeed destroys band BEFORE the tap that no downstream shifter
 * can put back.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * L1/P1/M1 are untouched: this reads no URL, opens no socket and generates its
 * own stimulus.
