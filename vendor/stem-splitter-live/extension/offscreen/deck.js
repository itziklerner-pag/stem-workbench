/**
 * ONE DECK'S hardware: its tab capture, its capture ring, its inference Worker
 * (and therefore its own wasm instance and its own ORT session), and its
 * LivePipeline.
 *
 * Everything a deck does NOT own, because there is exactly one of it:
 *   - the AudioContext          (two contexts have independent hardware clocks
 *                                and drift tens of ms per minute; nothing would
 *                                beat-match — docs/AUDIO.md §8.1)
 *   - the offscreen document     (Chrome allows one, full stop)
 *   - the master bus             (offscreen/master.js — a per-deck soft clipper
 *                                cannot protect the sum)
 *   - the GPU token              (engine/scheduler.js — one GPU, one queue, one
 *                                place to express priority)
 *   - the hop and the live plan  (different hops put the two decks' output
 *                                seconds apart and make them unmixable)
 *
 * ONE BACKEND PER DECK, and this is not negotiable in the other direction either.
 * spike/FINDINGS.md §6: ORT-Web serialises `run()` across every session sharing
 * a wasm instance, and a concurrent call throws `Session already started` and
 * leaves the session permanently wedged — so two sessions inside one worker is a
 * live grenade. Separate workers give separate wasm instances, which makes that
 * failure structurally impossible; the GPU serialises the work anyway (§6
 * measured a sequential pair at 1.01x the sum of two solo runs), so the second
 * worker costs memory and buys safety.
 *
 * THE WORKER IS NOW BEHIND A SEAM (S6, seed §16's option S2). The deck asks the
 * Host for a `Backend` — `load` / `separate` / `dispose`, waveforms in and
 * waveforms out — and today's Host answers with `workers/workerbackend.js`, which
 * is that same worker unchanged inside. What the deck kept is what is
 * ORCHESTRATION: session state and its mirror to the UI, the model bytes, and
 * the cross-deck GPU scheduler. What it no longer knows is that inference
 * involves a worker at all.
 *
 * NOTE the memory: each session is ~1.7 GB of wasm heap at peak. Two decks
 * measured 2091 MB renderer + 357 MB gpu. Deck B's backend is therefore created
 * LAZILY — on its first LIVE_START, never at boot — so a Mode 1 user never pays
 * for it. `host.createBackend()` is synchronous and returns a fresh instance, so
 * WHEN a deck pays is the deck's decision and not the Host's.

     * `pagehide` teardown deliberately does not await this at all. So the worst
     * case is a `stopDeck()` that never resolves, not a tab left muted.
     * Deliberately not raced against a timer: the same "await it and hope" that

     * re-inventing here with a clock.
