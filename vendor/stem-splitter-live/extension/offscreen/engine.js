/**
 * THE ENGINE'S ORCHESTRATION. It owns audio reality: the MediaStreams, the ONE
 * AudioContext, the capture worklets, the inference workers, the master bus, the
 * stem cache and the message switch that drives all of it.
 *
 * IT IS HOST-AGNOSTIC, and that is the property to preserve when editing it.
 * Everything platform-bound THIS file needs lives behind the duties of
 * `EngineHost` (`../shared/host.js`), supplied here by `./host.js` — the Chrome
 * extension's implementation, and the only `chrome.`-speaking module this file
 * reaches for. `ENGINE_HOST_DUTIES` is the list; this is what each is for here:
 *
 *   send / onMessage    the extension message bus
 *   captureStream       getUserMedia with the tabCapture constraints
 *   assetUrl            chrome.runtime.getURL, for the worklet modules
 *   onTeardown          pagehide — a document-lifetime event, not an engine one
 *   modelBytes /        the 109 MB weights: fetch + the Cache API (S7). Where
 *   modelCached /       they come from is the Host's; whether they are the model
 *   clearModel          is the unit's (`../shared/modelcache.js`).
 *   createBackend       which inference backend a deck gets (S6). Today's is
 *                       `../workers/workerbackend.js` — ORT in a Worker — and
 *                       swapping it is the Host's one line, not a fork of this.
 *
 * `./host.js` is the ONLY file under `offscreen/` that says `chrome.` at all:
 * `deck.js`, `cacheddeck.js`, `live.js` and `master.js` reach their worklet
 * modules and the ORT runtime through `assetUrl`, handed down from here — on
 * `shared` for the two kinds of deck, and as a constructor argument to
 * `MasterBus`, which is built before there is a context to await on.
 *
 * Nothing else here is Chrome-specific, and the audit trail is the whole list
 * rather than a sample: Web Audio (`AudioContext`, `AudioWorkletNode`),
 * `SharedArrayBuffer`, OPFS (`navigator.storage.getDirectory`),
 * `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices`, `self.crossOriginIsolated`,
 * `crypto.randomUUID` and `location.href`. That is every platform global this
 * file touches — plain web platform, all of it — so a second Host supplies the
 * five duties and this file runs unchanged (ADR 0001 decision 5).
 *
 * There is NO export job — the header said there was for a long time. `state.job`
 * survives as a shape: only `status`, `error` and `stage` are ever written (by
 * `fail()`), the other five fields only by the reset literal, and no surface
 * reads any of it. It is kept, not revived, because `fail()` has nowhere else to
 * record and removing it is not this slice's change.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MODE 3 (dual deck). Two decks live in THIS document, because Chrome allows
 * exactly one offscreen document and because two AudioContexts have independent
 * hardware clocks and would drift tens of ms per minute (docs/AUDIO.md §8.1).
 *
 *   shared, exactly one of each      per deck (offscreen/deck.js)
 *   ---------------------------      ------------------------------------------
 *   AudioContext @ 44100             MediaStream + capture worklet + SAB ring
 *   MasterBus (meter/clip/dest)      inference Worker  (its own wasm instance)
 *   GpuScheduler (one GPU token)     ORT session
 *   hop + live plan                  LivePipeline + playback worklet + stem ring
 *   crossfader position + curve      per-stem crossfader assignment column
 *
 * Deck B is created lazily on its first LIVE_START: each session is ~1.7 GB of
 * wasm heap at peak (two decks measured 2091 MB renderer), and a Mode 1 user
 * must not pay for a deck they never armed.

    // so at the moment deck A arms, deck B's capture already exists and the GPU
    // is about to be shared. Counting only running decks made deck A arm for a
    // machine to itself and then spend the session ~200 ms of cushion short:
    // measured at hop 2.6, deck A armed against 915 ms, settled at a 1206 ms p95
    // chunk with a 406 ms queue wait, and published 6 of 135 chunks unseparated
    // while deck B — which armed knowing about deck A — published 0 of 132.

    // arms deck B ten minutes later, deck A is still armed for one deck and will
    // drop a few percent of chunks until it is restarted. The named fix is a

    // be used", which it sends on open for both decks — so by the time deck A
    // goes live the engine knows the GPU is about to be shared, whether or not
    // deck B has a capture yet.

    // the population — so computing it twice gives the two decks DIFFERENT

    // against 2600 ms (clamped), and they sat 0.90 s apart. At hop 1.95 the same
    // run put them 93 ms apart only because neither hit the clamp.

 * THE authoritative crossfader echo (settled 2026-08-09).

 * The UI owns the fader widget, so it is tempting to let it be the source of

 * `position` and `effective` DIVERGE. When only one deck is loaded the engine
 * parks the fader on that deck so a lone deck is never attenuated 3 dB by a
 * control nobody touched (effectiveXfPosition) — so what the user set and what
 * is being applied are two different numbers, and a UI that renders the first
 * while the audio follows the second is lying to a performer.
 *
 * Six bugs in this project have come from a UI inferring a value the engine knew.
 * This message exists so there is nothing left to infer:
 *
 *   XF_STATE { position, effective, parked, curve, assign:{A:[…],B:[…]}, loaded:{A,B} }
 *
 * `assign` is one entry PER STEM, in `STEMS` order — six of them now, not four.
 * A UI that writes only the first four leaves guitar and piano unassigned, which
 * engine/mixer.js §xfStemGain calls out as the failure mode of the OFF case.
 *
 *   position   0..1, what the user last set. Survives parking.
 *   effective  0..1, what the gains are actually computed from. Equal to
 *              `position` whenever both decks are loaded.
 *   parked     null, or 'A'/'B' — the deck the fader is pinned to and why the
 *              two numbers differ. Render the cap at `effective` and, if
 *              `parked`, say so rather than letting the user wonder.
 *   assign     per deck, in STEMS order, one of 'A' | 'B' | 'XF'.
 *   loaded     which decks have audio. Parking is a function of exactly this.
 *
 * Throttled to XF_ECHO_HZ: a drag produces ~60 position messages a second and
 * the echo is for OTHER surfaces and for reconnect, not for the widget that
 * just moved. Discrete changes (curve, assign, a deck loading) bypass the
 * throttle — they are rare and must never be a frame late.

         * always describes A would answer "why is my deck silent?" with a
         * confident, well-formatted, entirely accurate description of the deck
         * that is working fine. The reader would then trust it, because it looks
         * like an answer.

         * That is the exact shape of the four green-and-silent defects this
         * project has already shipped: a correct measurement of the wrong thing,
         * presented as if it were a measurement of the right thing. Every one of
         * them was caught late precisely because something upstream looked
         * healthy. Here the failure is foreseeable, so it is designed out rather
         * than diagnosed later: `decks.A` and `decks.B` both exist, both are
         * always present (B is `null` when it has never been created), and the
         * reader is forced to say which deck they mean.
         *
         * Shared facts — `ctx`, `gpu`, `xf`, `output`, `devices`, `doc` — appear
         * ONCE, at the top level, for the mirror-image reason: there is exactly
         * one of each, and duplicating them per deck would invite the reader to
