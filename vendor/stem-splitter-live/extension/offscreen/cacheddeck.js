/**
 * A CACHED DECK. Plays the already-separated stems — every name in `STEMS`, six
 * of them — out of the stem cache.
 *
 * This is the other half of Mode 3: one live deck doing the GPU work, one cached
 * deck costing nothing. It deliberately shares NOTHING with `LivePipeline`
 * except the two things that must be shared — the AudioContext and the master
 * bus — because almost everything in the live pipeline exists to hide a 7.8 s
 * forward pass, and a cached deck does not have one:
 *
 *   no inference worker   the stems are on disk
 *   no hop                there is no chunk schedule
 *   no causal window      nothing is being estimated
 *   no jitter cushion     nothing can be late
 *   no backpressure ladder, no passthrough plane, no drops, no `starving`
 *   no algorithmic latency at all — except the transpose lanes' 69.7 ms group
 *                         delay, which is constant at every setting INCLUDING 0
 *                         and is in latencySec() below; plus the worklet's own
 *                         output buffer, the same ~48 ms any Web Audio graph has
 *
 * What it DOES share, on purpose, is everything downstream of the summing point:
 * the same `stem-playback` worklet, the same RING_PLANES-plane ring, the same gain
 * slots and per-sample ramps, the same pre-crossfader meter tap, and the same
 * master soft clipper. A cached deck and a live deck must be indistinguishable
 * to the mixer, or the crossfader between them would not be a crossfader.
 *
 * BORROWED, NOT OWNED: `ctx` and `master` belong to the offscreen document and
 * are shared with the live deck. `dispose()` must never disconnect them.
 *
 * AND IT RUNS BOTH ANALYSIS TAPS. `LIVE_STATE.key` (engine/keytap.js) and
 * `LIVE_STATE.bpm` (engine/bpmtap.js) are published from here on the same 10 Hz
 * heartbeat and the same stem ring as the live deck's, for the same reason the
 * gain slots and the meter tap are shared: a surface must not have to know which
 * kind of deck it is reading. A cached deck that omitted `bpm` would not show a
 * blank — `offscreen.js` swaps deck A to this class on a cache hit, so the UI
 * would hold the LIVE deck's last tempo over a different track, and a readout
 * from another song is wrong rather than stale. Both taps are reset by
 * `load()`, `stop()` and — the one that matters here — `seek()`.

 * 1. A cached deck loads at frame 0. Starting it against a video the user is
 *    1:30 into puts the stems at the top of the song and the picture in the
 *    middle — and the video lock then "corrects" it by dragging the video back
 *    to 0:00, which reads as the deck hijacking the transport. The user's

 * 2. A deck that ran to the end has its write head parked at the end, so
 *    `play()` alone re-ends it on the next fill and the replay is silent. That
 *    is the FIRST gesture anyone makes after a prime completes: the track
 *    finished, press play again.
 *
 * The threshold stops an ordinary pause/resume flushing the ring for a

   * with the same 5 ms of slop — and a SIBLING rather than two lines inside
   * tickKey(), so each tap has its own entry point and its own timestamp.
   *
   * The 5 ms of slop is because a setInterval(100) fires at 99 ms often enough
   * that a strict `>= 100` gate silently halves the rate. The gate is on the WALL
   * CLOCK rather than on the call because pushState() is not only the FILL_HZ
   * heartbeat — load(), play(), pause(), seek(), stop() and the end-of-track
   * branch all force one, and without the gate a burst of those would weight
   * whatever was playing during the burst.
   *
   * The two differences from tickKey(), and both are the fault contract:
   *
   *   1. It cannot throw into the heartbeat. pushState() is the 10 Hz publisher
   *      AND the thing every transport method uses to report; an exception
   *      escaping here would take the whole readout down over a DISPLAY-ONLY
   *      label.
   *   2. It is not a bare `catch {}`. The throw is counted, the first message is
   *      latched and logged once, and the wire says `state: 'fault'` from then on
   *      (bpmPayload()). A tap that silently stopped would present as one that is
   *      listening and has not decided — the "an assertion must FAIL when it
   *      cannot look" shape moved out of the harness and into shipped code.
   *
   * Once latched the tap is OFF until the next load() or stop(). That is on
   * purpose: a tick that threw part-way may have left the cursor, the envelope
   * ring or `prevM` inconsistent, and carrying on would risk a confident lock
   * derived from torn state. It also bounds a repeating fault at one throw rather
