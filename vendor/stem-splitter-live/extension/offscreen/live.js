/**
 * ONE DECK of live buffered playback. Owns that deck's causal scheduler, its
 * playback worklet and its backpressure ladder. Everything pure lives in
 * engine/live.js; this file is the plumbing that connects one capture ring, one
 * inference worker and one playback worklet.
 *
 * Mode 1 runs a single instance (deck 'A'). Mode 3 runs two, sharing ONE
 * AudioContext, ONE master bus (offscreen/master.js) and ONE GPU token
 * (engine/scheduler.js), with a separate inference Worker each.
 *
 * Message contract (fixed by the spec; the console UI builds to the same one).
 * Every message in and out carries `deck: 'A' | 'B'`; the deck field is injected
 * by the `send` dependency, so nothing in this file has to remember it.
 *
 *   UI -> here   LIVE_START {deck} · LIVE_STOP {deck} · SET_HOP {seconds}
 *                STEM_GAIN {deck, stem, gainDb} · STEM_MUTE {deck, stem, muted}
 *                STEM_SOLO {deck, stem, soloed} · MASTER_GAIN {deck, gainDb}
 *                XFADER {position} · XF_CURVE {curve} · XF_ASSIGN {deck, stem, target}
 *                PITCH {deck, semitones}  -> setPitch(), integer in [-6, +6]
 *   here -> UI   LIVE_STATE {deck, status, bufferSec, targetSec, rtf, drops, key, bpm, ...} ~10 Hz
 *                METERS {deck, peak:{...}, rms:{...}}                             ~30 Hz
 *                LIVE_ERROR {deck, code, message}
 *
 * `LIVE_STATE.key` is `{state, concertTonic, mode, confidence}` and the engine
 * reports the CONCERT tonic only — it never applies the transpose offset and
 * never learns which instrument the user plays. The UI calls
 * `chroma.js::displayKey(concertTonic, mode, semitones, instrument)`: one
 * mod-12, one function, one call site. See engine/keytap.js::payload().
 *
 * `LIVE_STATE.bpm` is its sibling — `{state, bpm, confidence, beatFrame}` from
 * engine/bpmtap.js, tapped off the `drums` planes of the same ring on the same
 * 10 Hz heartbeat. `beatFrame` is an ABSOLUTE stem-ring frame and the ONE way to
 * turn it into a phase is `bpmtap.js::beatPhaseAt()`; do not add a `phase` field
 * here, for the reason that file's payload() gives.
 *
 * It has a FIFTH state this file adds and the module does not: `'fault'`, with a
 * `fault` string and a `faults` count beside it. The detector runs inside the
 * heartbeat, so it may not throw into it — but "degrade to no estimate" and
 * "silently do nothing" are the same wire value unless the failure is named, and
 * a feature that quietly reports nothing when it breaks is indistinguishable
 * from one that is working and hearing nothing. See bpmPayload().
 *
 * SET_HOP, XFADER and XF_CURVE are GLOBAL — no deck field. The hop especially:
 * two decks on different hops emit audio seconds apart and nothing beat-matches
 * (docs/AUDIO.md §8.1), so the offscreen document applies one hop to both.
 *
 * LIVE_ERROR codes, and which are advisory (the console's ADVISORY_CODES must
 * stay in step; tools/run-ext.mjs asserts the two sets are identical):
 *   HOP_PENDING · HOP_MARGINAL           advisory — the deck is still playing
 *   CHUNK_FAILED · PUMP_FAILED · HALTED  the pipeline is broken
 *   START_FAILED · NOT_CAPTURING         it never started
 *   OUTPUT_STALLED · OUTPUT_SILENT       it is running and you are hearing
 *   OUTPUT_DEAD                          NOTHING. See watchOutput(); the three
 *                                        cover DISJOINT regions of the chain —
 *                                        the render thread stopped, the master
 *                                        bus ate it, and the deck never produced
 *                                        it. All three are FATAL to the console
 *                                        (they are not in ADVISORY_CODES), which
 *                                        is correct: a deck making no sound is
 *                                        stopped as far as the user is concerned.
 *
 * Gain messages take the fast path (UI -> offscreen in one hop) and are applied
 * inside the playback worklet, so a fader move is audible in ~1 render quantum
 * plus the output latency — NOT one hop later. That is the point of the whole
 * design (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §1.6).

 *

/**
 * ONE TICK of the third output watchdog arm — "this deck is playing and it is
 * producing NOTHING", the failure the other two arms are structurally unable to
 * see. Pure, so `node test.js live` can drive it without an audio graph.
 *
 * WHY IT HAD TO BE A THIRD ARM RATHER THAN A LOOSER SECOND ONE. `OUTPUT_SILENT`
 * fires on `meters.peak.master > 1e-3 && busPeak < 1e-6` — it requires the
 * playback worklet to be SUMMING SIGNAL, so it can only ever catch a break
 * BELOW the summing point (a zeroed crossfader or master slot, an unassigned
 * curve, a missing connect). `OUTPUT_STALLED` fires when the worklet stops
 * posting `health`, which it does from inside `process()` — a deck emitting
 * digital zero heartbeats perfectly. So a deck whose audio is zero AT OR ABOVE
 * the stem-gain slots — a silent capture, an all-zero model output, a ring that
 * is written but empty — raises no alarm at all, and that is exactly the report
 * this arm exists for: buffer moving, every meter dead, no sound, no error.
 *
 * The two arms cover disjoint regions and neither is widened: this one only
 * fires when even the PRE-crossfader stem meters are zero, which is the one
 * state `OUTPUT_SILENT` can never be in.
 *
 * IT MUST FAIL WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK (AGENTS.md). A playing deck that has never
 * reported a meter frame is `blind`, and `blind` counts toward the alarm — it is
 * the failure, not an excuse from it.
 *
 * BOTH EXCUSES ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE MEASUREMENT (`AGENTS.md`) — they are read
 * off OUR OWN STATE, so the silence being excused cannot manufacture its own
 * excuse. There are exactly two, and each is a case where digital black is the
 * ratified correct output:
 *
 *   1. every resolved gain is zero — the user killed or muted everything;
 *   2. the speaker is inside a PUBLISHED PASSTHROUGH SPAN and the passthrough
 *      gain is zero. That is QA-15's ratified ducking rule (engine/mixer.js
 *      passthroughGain: "never louder than the quietest thing the user asked to
 *      hear"), so a dropped chunk with a killed stem is SILENT ON PURPOSE. At
 *      hop 1.0 with a stem killed that is 57 s of a 71 s run (STATUS §3a) —
 *      without this branch the watchdog would cry wolf on the ratified
 *      behaviour, which is the failure this project has been burned by twice.
 *      `passthroughNow` comes from `passSpans` and the ring read pointer, not
 *      from the audio.
 *
 * TWO INPUT READINGS, TWO CLOCKS, AND THAT IS THE FIX RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT.
 * This function used to take one `inputPeak`, read from `ring.peaks()` — the
 * CAPTURE clock, i.e. what the tab is producing *now* — and compare it against
 * `meters`, which is the SPEAKER, `latencySec()` behind. Two different points on
 * one delay line, treated as simultaneous. When a tab woke up mid-count the
 * verdict flipped `dead-input -> dead-mixer` with nothing in the mixer changing,
 * and since the console picks the remedy off the variant, the user was told to
 * restart a working deck instead of to press play in their tab. The two remedies
 * are opposites, so this was not a cosmetic mislabel.
 *
 * The two readings answer two different questions and each gets the only clock
 * that can answer it:
 *
 *   inputPeakPlayed — WHAT WAS OWED. The capture-ring peak over the frames the
 *     output has just played. Output frame n is by construction the audio
 *     captured at live-relative capture frame n (see latencySec()), so this is
 *     the SAME AUDIO at two points in the chain and the comparison is exact.
 *     `null` means we could not sample it, which is never an excuse — see below.
 *
 *   inputPeakNow — WHETHER THE DECK IS ABOUT TO PAY. The capture-ring peak at
 *     the capture clock. It cannot say anything about what the speaker is
 *     carrying; it is the only thing that can say audio is IN FLIGHT.
 *
 * That yields a seventh verdict, `inflight`, and it is the honest answer to the
 * state that produced the false alarm: nothing at the speaker, nothing was owed
 * at those frames (the tab was silent then), and the tab is producing audio now.
 * The deck is not dead — it is `latencySec()` behind, which is its job. It is
 * NOT in DEAD_VERDICTS and it resets the counter.
 *
 * `inflight` cannot excuse a real break: it requires `inputPeakPlayed` to be
 * silent, i.e. the deck owed nothing over the frames in question. A mixer that
 * eats live audio reads `dead-mixer` and fires exactly as before.
 *
 * FAIL WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK. A `null` inputPeakPlayed does not suppress the
 * alarm and does not get to claim the tab was silent: the deck is still dead,
 * and the verdict is `dead-mixer` — the deck-side remedy — because telling a
 * user their video is paused is a claim, and we do not make claims on evidence
 * we could not read. `LivePipeline.inputWindowMisses` counts every such tick so
 * a gate can see the degradation instead of inferring it.
 *
 * NEITHER READING GATES THE ALARM ITSELF: a value read off the system under
 * test must not be able to talk the instrument out of firing.
 *
 * IT LOOKS AT EVERY STEM IN `STEMS`, NOT AT FOUR NAMES. The list used to be
 * spelled `p.drums, p.bass, p.other, p.vocals` — which at six stems would have
 * made a deck emitting nothing but guitar and piano read as digital black and
 * raise OUTPUT_DEAD on a working deck. Driving it off `STEMS` is also what keeps
 * the missing-key check below honest: it can only know a key is missing if it
 * knows which keys it is owed.

   *
   * IT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* THE RING DEPTH, and this cost a measurement to
   * learn, so it is written down rather than left as an obvious choice.
   *
   * The first version used the instantaneous cushion — "how much audio is left
   * before the listener hears a hole" — which reads as the honest number and is
   * catastrophically wrong as a scheduling input. The ring depth SAWTOOTHS by a
   * whole hop on every chunk (a chunk lands, depth jumps by 1.95 s, then
   * drains), so at the instant a chunk is submitted the depth is already partway
   * down its ramp — around 1.25 s at hop 1.95. Deck B's queue wait behind deck A
   * is ~0.4 s and one inference is ~1.0 s, so `wait + est` came to ~1.4 s
   * against a ~1.25 s "budget" and L3 demoted deck B on EVERY SINGLE HOP.
   * Measured, over 182 s: deck A 1 drop / 0 demotions, deck B 95 drops / 95
   * demotions — deck B was permanently unseparated on a machine with 15 % GPU
   * headroom that had just run the same pair cleanly for 45 s. The policy was
   * bistable on a coin-flip inequality, which is the worst possible property for
   * something that decides whether a deck makes music.
   *
   * The ring-depth question is real, but it is L2's, not L3's: `skipFrames`
   * already fires on `cushion < lowWater` with a MEASURED trough (see
   * bufferMinSec) rather than a prediction, and it degrades the same span to
   * passthrough. Having L3 predict the same failure from a noisier signal
   * double-counts it and fires first.
   *
   * So L3 answers only the question L2 cannot see, because it is about the OTHER
   * deck: "is the GPU so oversubscribed that this chunk cannot be delivered
   * within its hop even though nothing is wrong with this deck?" On this machine
   * that needs `wait + est > 1950 ms`, i.e. deck A holding the GPU for the best

   * Arm the playhead. This one number sets the deck's entire latency AND its

   * produces a deck that plays perfectly and separates nothing.
   *
   * Zero-underrun needs a playback start offset S >= H + X + T, where T is the
   * time one chunk takes END TO END. Chunk 0 lands at H + T(0), so we hold for a
   * further X + LIVE_CUSHION_SEC. The cushion just before chunk k lands is then
   *
   *     cushion_trough = LIVE_CUSHION_SEC + T(0) - T(k)
   *
   * — the offset is anchored to ONE sample of a noisy distribution, and if T(0)
   * happens to be smaller than the steady-state T the trough is negative FOREVER.
   *
   * IN MODE 1 THAT WAS A `ponytail:` (shared/config.js LIVE_CUSHION_SEC). IN
   * MODE 3 IT IS FATAL, AND MEASURED. Two decks share one GPU, so the second
   * deck's chunks take roughly N x one inference — its own, plus the wait behind
   * the priority deck. But its CHUNK 0 runs before that steady state exists, so
   * T(0) is systematically the smallest sample the deck will ever see. Measured
   * over 340 s at hop 1.95: deck B armed with a chunk-0 offset, settled at a
   * 1471 ms steady-state chunk time, and spent the whole run with a 33 ms
   * cushion against a 120 ms low-water mark — 175 of 175 chunks published as
   * unseparated passthrough, with zero underruns and a perfectly healthy-looking
   * transport. The giveaway was that deck B reported LESS latency than deck A
   * (3.07 s vs 3.25 s) when it is the deck that waits.
   *
   * THE SAME MISTAKE, TWICE, FROM THE SAME HABIT. LIVE_CUSHION_SEC was first
   * derived from a spread measured over a 75 s window — one phase of an
   * oscillation longer than that — and this arm law was anchored to T_inf(chunk
   * 0), one sample taken at the least representative moment there is. Both were
   * a single observation of a noisy distribution, promoted to a permanent
   * constant. Before you size ANYTHING here off an observation, ask how many
   * samples it is and whether the moment you took it was typical; if the answer
   * is "one" and "no", you are about to write the third one.
   *
   * So the reference is no longer chunk 0's luck. `armRefMs` is supplied by the
   * offscreen document as `p95(observed inference) x (decks running)` — the
   * scheduler's own estimate of what a chunk will cost this deck once the GPU is
   * shared N ways. `max()` with T(0) keeps the Mode 1 guarantee that we never
   * arm with LESS cushion than the one chunk we have actually measured.
   *
   * The cost is honest and worth stating: dual deck arms ~1 s later than single
   * deck (4.4 s vs 3.4 s at hop 1.95), and both decks arm with the SAME offset,
   * so they no longer disagree about how far behind the music they are.
