 * assertions as toothless on exactly that evidence. The instrument's shape has
 * to match the claim: these eleven are reported by
 *
 *     node extension/ui/dev/selftest.mjs
 *
 * and the runnable battery that applies them, one at a time, is

 * ANCHORS CUT AGAINST `5993d32`. `made at` names the anchor TEXT rather than a
 * line number, which decays first. Counts are this file's, clean total 124.
 * The battery reports the ANCHOR and the RED separately (`INTEGRATION.md` 24):
 * an anchor that stopped matching is a decayed instrument to re-cut, and a
 * mutation that matches but stops redding is that OR a real coverage loss.
