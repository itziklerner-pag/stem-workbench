/**
 * The embedded deck — ONE deck, drawn inside the user's own YouTube page.
 *
 * It is a VIEW, exactly like the side panel and the DJ console: it holds no
 * audio, owns no truth, and every number on it arrived on a message. The engine
 * is the same offscreen document the other build uses, unchanged. That is the
 * whole design of this build — a different surface, not a different product.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE, so nobody adds it back by reflex:
 *  - a crossfader, an assign row, a deck B. One deck, and the messages this file
 *    sends all name deck A explicitly rather than letting the field default.
 *  - a hop control. The engine's default is right for one deck, and a select
 *    box that changes the separation schedule does not belong under a video.
 *  - an export / download path. This build is the live gesture; Mode 2 offline
 *    export lives in the side-panel build, which has the `downloads` permission
 *    this one does not request.
 *  - an "arm" button. There cannot be one: only a browser-level invocation mints
 *    a tabCapture grant, so no button on any of our pages can (ARCHITECTURE §7
 *    R4). The toolbar click is the arm gesture and this panel is its result.

 *
 * The law itself is NOT copied: `faderDb` / `dbToFader` come from audio-math,

  /**
   * THE FADER'S OWN KEYS. ENTRY POINT: this element, and only when it HAS FOCUS
   * inside the deck's iframe — which is why nothing here is in `hostKeys()` and
   * why none of it can collide with YouTube. A key pressed on the watch page
   * never reaches this listener; a key pressed here never reaches the watch
   * page, because the frame is cross-origin and this handler swallows it.
   *
   * ALT IS THE FADER'S MAC-REACHABLE MODIFIER, added because
   * HOME, END, PAGE UP AND PAGE DOWN ARE ALL UNREACHABLE ON A MAC. A MacBook has
   * none of the four as physical keys — they are `fn`+`←`/`→`/`↑`/`↓`, which is
   * not a shortcut anyone reaches for and which the browser often eats first. So
   * BOTH the ARIA landmark convention and the coarse step were, on that
   * hardware, bindings with no keys. One modifier now carries both:
   *
   *   Alt+↑ / Alt+↓          unity / −∞      (Home / End)
   *   Shift+Alt+↑ / +↓       ±6 dB           (PageUp / PageDown)
   *
   * WHY ALT AND NOT SHIFT ALONE: `Shift`+`↑`/`↓` IS ALREADY TAKEN, below — it is
   * the fine ±0.1 dB step. Alt already means "jump to a landmark" on this
   * surface (`Alt`+a digit resets that strip's fader to unity, and so does an
   * Alt-click on the cap), and adding Shift to it reads as the same gesture made
   * bigger, which is what `Shift` does on the speed buttons too.
   *
   * THE SHIFT TEST HAS TO COME FIRST INSIDE THIS BRANCH. Before the coarse step
   * existed, `Shift`+`Alt`+`↑` fell straight through to `apply(0)` — i.e. the
   * chord was already bound, to unity, by accident. That is the one real
   * in-build collision this addition had, and it is resolved by ordering rather
   * than by a second listener.
   *
   * WHY NOT ALT+LEFT / ALT+RIGHT, even though plain `←`/`→` alias `↓`/`↑` here:
   * `⌥`+`←`/`→` is YOUTUBE'S previous/next chapter (`Ctrl`+`←`/`→` on Windows),
   * and `Alt`+`←`/`→` is CHROME'S back/forward. Both are out of reach of this
   * listener today, but aliasing them would put a live binding one `hostKeys()`
   * entry away from stealing either. Up and down only, with or without Shift.
   *
   * ponytail: ceiling — on Windows, `Alt`+`Shift` PRESSED AND RELEASED ALONE is
   * the OS keyboard-layout toggle in multi-layout setups. Pressing an arrow
   * inside the chord suppresses it in every configuration we can reason about,
   * because the toggle fires on a bare modifier release, but it is the OS's
   * behaviour and not ours to guarantee. Upgrade path if it is ever reported:
   * move the coarse step to `Alt`+`PageUp`/`PageDown`… which has the same fn
   * problem, so realistically it becomes `Alt`+`Shift` staying and a note in the
   * overlay. Nothing here is load-bearing enough to design around it unasked.
   *
   * HOME, END, PAGE UP AND PAGE DOWN ARE KEPT as aliases. They cost nothing,
   * Home/End are the ARIA convention, and a full-size keyboard has all four —
   * removing them would help nobody.

/**
 * HOW TO ARM A TAB THAT IS NOT ARMED — the one thing the page behind this frame
 * cannot say. The header names no title and no URL because the watch page is
 * already showing both; this sentence is what survives, and it is here because a
 * browser-level invocation is the only thing that mints a capture grant, so no
 * button on this surface could ever stand in for it (ARCHITECTURE §7 R4).
 *
 * IT NOW NAMES THE CHORD TOO. The keyboard route existed from the first release
 * and only the setup page — seen once, on install — ever said so. The deck is
 * where a user is standing when they want it.
 *
 * READ FROM THE PLATFORM, NEVER TYPED HERE. `host.armShortcut()` answers with
 * whatever the browser is actually bound to, because the user can rebind it, and
 * a deck that stated a chord the browser does not honour would be worse than one
 * that said nothing. With nothing bound the sentence falls back to the toolbar
 * icon alone rather than printing an empty key cap.
 *
 * THE ANNOUNCED FORM IS THE SAME BRANCH `welcome.js` MAKES, and it is one line
 * of reasoning rather than two: `chordLabel()` returns `say !== text` exactly
 * when the platform DRAWS GLYPHS, so that comparison is the whole test for
 * whether an accessible name is worth having. Setting one unconditionally is not
 * a neutral extra — it REPLACES text a screen reader could already read, which
 * is the defect this repo shipped on every non-Mac machine until `chordLabel()`
 * was corrected to join both forms with the separator it draws.
 *
 * BOTH ROUTES THIS SENTENCE OFFERS ARE THE SHOW/HIDE GESTURE, and following
 * either one from this exact state puts the deck away. `armTab()` ends with
 * `notifyTab(tab.id, 'toggle')` and `content.js` unmounts on a `'toggle'` that
 * finds a deck already up — so the tab arms and the surface the instruction was
 * read on disappears, and a second press brings it back armed. That is not new
 * and not the chord's: the toolbar icon this line has named since 0.1.0 reaches
 * the identical `armTab()`. It is written down here because the sentence is now
 * an instruction with two halves, and the next person to read the first half
 * should not have to rediscover what the second one does.

 * (`SPEED_KEY_LOCK`), and Chrome's media pipeline does the work — exactly as it
 * does for YouTube's own speed menu. The capture tap is downstream of it, so the
 * model still sees one integer sample clock at 44 100 Hz and AGENTS.md's
 * prohibition is nowhere near this.
 *
 * SPEED IS KEY-LOCKED, reversing an earlier varispeed design. This block used to

 * transposed the audio before the tap, so the separator was fed the wrong key.
 * SPEED moves the tempo; TRANSPOSE is the only control that moves the key; the
 * two compose. Nothing on this surface may print an interval for a rate again —
 * a label stating an invariant the code does not hold is the same defect as an
 * assertion doing it, except the user is the one who finds out.

 *   - `{type:'SPEED', deck, rate}` to the ENGINE, which is the only place that
 *     can tell a live deck from a cached one and the only place a refusal can be
 *     said (offscreen.js). It echoes SPEED_STATE on both paths.

 * reader therefore does not branch on `live.source` and must not learn to: a
 * surface that had to know which kind of deck it was reading is the defect the
 * shared field name prevents.
 *
 * IT IS ADVANCED, NOT USED RAW. That message is published at 10 Hz and crosses a
 * host message hop, so the sample is 50-100 ms old by the time this surface
 * paints it; at 128 BPM one beat is 469 ms, so an uncorrected lag is a fifth of a
 * beat of standing phase error. `Date.now() - at` is that age, and the wall clock
 * is the ONE clock the offscreen document and this page share — their
 * `performance` time origins differ, so a difference between those is
 * meaningless. `SR`, not the page rate: the DAC drains the ring in real time
 * whatever speed the element is running at.
 *
 * NULL, NEVER 0, WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK. BOTH engines OMIT `playFrames` when the
 * deck has no output ring, and frame 0 is a real position the ring takes at the
 * start of every run — so `Number.isFinite` is the discriminator and a missing
 * field must not become a number. `beatPulse()` refuses a null phase and the dot
 * goes static, which is the honest state: we have the tempo and not the beat.
 *
 * NOT `positionSec`, WHICH IS THE OTHER FIELD ON THIS MESSAGE. That one is a
 * TRACK position in seconds (`readBase + readFrames()`, clamped and divided by
