/**
 * The deck's Host, as a Chrome extension. This is the ONE module `embed.js` is
 * allowed to import that knows what `chrome` is or what a frame is; the duties
 * it implements and the rules they have to hold are written down in
 * `../shared/host.js`.
 *
 * It is six callable duties and two namespaces long on purpose. The seam is
 * not an abstraction layer — "no abstraction with one implementation" is a
 * standing rule here — it is the list of things a second application would
 * have to supply, kept short enough that the list itself is the specification.
 *
 * TWO WIRES LEAVE THROUGH HERE AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME WIRE.
 *  - `send` / `onMessage` ride `chrome.runtime`, the EXTENSION BUS: a broadcast
 *    between the deck, the engine and the service worker. The envelope on it is
 *    the UNIT's (`{ v, to, from }`) and this file carries it verbatim.
 *  - `page` / `transport` ride `postMessage` across the IFRAME BOUNDARY to
 *    `content.js`, which is the host's own other end. That protocol —
 *    `from: 'stem-splitter-live'` out, `from: 'stem-splitter-live-host'` back —
 *    is entirely the HOST's, so this file is free to name its own fields, and
 *    it does: the seam speaks ADR 0001 decision 4's `currentTime` where the
 *    wire says `seekTo`.
 *
 * The remaining four — `storageGet`, `storageSet`, `onStorageChanged` and
 * `armShortcut` — are not a wire at all. They read and write platform state
 * (`chrome.storage`, `chrome.commands`) that has no other end to talk to.
 *
 * LATE BINDING IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE `send` BODY. `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
 * is looked up when the message is sent, not when this module is imported,
 * because `tools/embed-smoke.mjs` replaces that PROPERTY after the deck has
 * booted and that patch is the only window onto the outgoing wire. Write
 * `chrome.runtime.sendMessage.bind(chrome.runtime)` here and the recorder stays
 * empty for the rest of the run, taking the transpose-ceiling and speed/ad-gate
 * assertions green-on-nothing with it. See rule 2 in `../shared/host.js`.
 */

 * This context's address on the bus, READ OUT OF THE SEAM'S OWN DECLARATION.
 * The deck's outbound envelope is composed in `embed.js` (`to: BUS.engine` /
 * `to: BUS.host`, `from: BUS.deck`) because the addresses are the unit's
 * protocol; the host reads `to` in exactly one place, here, to answer the one
 * question only the transport can — "is this one mine?"
 *
 * It was `const ME = 'ui'` until Host interface v1 (S11) put the address set in
 * `../shared/host.js`, where a second Host reading its duties finds them.

/**
 * THE ONLY TWO AREAS THIS HOST WILL INDEX, and the refusal is a P1 guard rather

 *
 * `chrome.storage[area]` is an index into the whole namespace, and the
 * `'local'|'session'` union next door is a JSDoc comment that runs nowhere. So
 * before this list existed, `storageSet('sync', …)` from the deck WOULD HAVE
 * WORKED — and `chrome.storage.sync` is a network write, which is the one thing
 * CONTRIBUTING.md P1 forbids after the model download and SECURITY.md promotes
 * to a security property. Until the areas became a parameter, `sync` was
 * unreachable from the deck by construction, because every call site read
 * `chrome.storage.local` literally. This keeps that impossibility while keeping
 * the parameter.
 *
 * IT ALSO GIVES A SECOND HOST A DEFINED ANSWER instead of an accident. Without
 * it an unexpected area was undefined behaviour that HAPPENED to reject on
 * `storageGet` (`undefined.get` inside an `async` method) and HAPPENED to throw
 * synchronously on the other two. Both refusals are now deliberate, both are
 * asserted in `test.js`, and rule 5 in `../shared/host.js` says which is which:
 * `storageGet` rejects, because one of its two call sites is a module-scope
 * `.then().catch()` that a synchronous throw jumps straight past; the other two
 * throw at the call site, because a wrong area there is a bug in the deck rather
 * than a failure of the platform, and the cheapest place to be told is the line
