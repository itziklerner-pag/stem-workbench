/**
 * The decisions the embedded deck makes, kept pure so they have a check. No
 * DOM, no chrome.*, no imports. Runnable check:
 *
 *     node extension/ui/embed-state.js
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION, named here so the line above stays true: `isMac()` reads the
 * ambient `navigator` when it is given no argument, guarded by `typeof`. It
 * takes the object as a parameter for exactly that reason — every assertion
 * passes one, so nothing in this file's check depends on the machine it runs
 * on.
 *
 * THERE IS NO START BUTTON. The user's own player is the only transport in this
 * build, so "should the pipeline be running" is derived, not clicked — and a
 * derived answer that nobody can press is exactly the kind of thing that has to
 * be testable without a browser and a 172 MiB download in the way.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE OFFSET IS STRUCTURAL. Read this before trying to close it.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Our output at wall time T is the content the tab RENDERED at T − Δ, where Δ
 * is the pipeline's buffer (hop + floor, ~2.4 s). The video shows V(T). Sync
 * would require V(T − Δ) = V(T): the video at the position it held Δ seconds
 * ago. For a playing video that is false at every T.
 *
 * Every fix that suggests itself moves the INPUT by the same amount, because
 * the video we would manipulate is the source of the audio we capture:
 *   - seek back by Δ  -> synced for exactly Δ s, then the replayed audio
 *                        arrives and it is Δ behind again
 *   - skip the replay -> empties the buffer, forces a re-prime, Δ behind again
 *   - playbackRate    -> scales both sides; the gap shrinks by the rate and
 *                        never reaches zero
 *   - pause to prime  -> a paused tab produces no audio; it deadlocks
 * The only escape is rendering the user a DELAYED COPY of the video, which
 * means reading the media stream. That is L1, and it is a different product.
 *
 * So the deck is honest about Δ instead: it shows it. The one lever that
 * genuinely shrinks it is the hop, and that is the engine's call, not this
 * file's.

/**
 * SHOULD THE PIPELINE BE RUNNING RIGHT NOW?
 *
 * `videoPlaying` is TRI-STATE, and what the third value MEANS depends on
 * `hosted` — which is the correction for a real defect, not a refinement:
 *   true  — the page told us its player is playing
 *   false — the page told us it is paused
 *   null  — nobody has told us. Then:
 *             hosted  -> WAIT. There is a page above us and it has not spoken
 *                        yet; this is the boot window, not the absence of a
 *                        signal.
 *             not     -> RUN. Nothing is ever going to tell us (opened
 *                        directly, a harness, a future host), and a feature
 *                        that silently does nothing when its input is missing
 *                        is the worst of the outcomes.
 *
 * **Measured, on the first run of tools/embed-smoke.mjs.** Without the `hosted`
 * split, `null` meant "run" from the instant the deck booted — so opening it on
 * a PAUSED video started a capture ~1.2 s before the page reported `paused`,
 * and the engine begins fetching 172 MiB of weights the moment a capture
 * attaches (offscreen.js captureStart). The engine log said `deck A capture
 * started` with nothing playing. The deck then stopped itself when the real
 * signal landed, which is exactly why it was invisible: every state the UI
 * showed afterwards was correct.
 *
 * `hosted` IS A FACT ABOUT THE HOST, NOT ABOUT FRAMES. It is
 * `host.transport != null` — does whatever is hosting this deck report a
 * player. It used to be "am I in a frame", and that was the same answer only by
 * accident of there being one Host: a Host that draws this deck as a top-level
 * document and reports its player would have been read here as "nobody is ever
 * going to tell me", i.e. as licence to start a capture, and behind it a model
 * download, on boot.
 *
 * ponytail: ceiling — a Host that DECLARES a transport and then never speaks
 * leaves this waiting for ever instead of falling back. Today the Host that
 * declares one is the page that created this frame, so it cannot happen.
 * Upgrade path: a deadline (fall back after ~2 s of silence) if a second host
 * ever embeds this deck.
 *
 * `halted` is the latch a failure sets. Without it, "armed + playing + idle" is
 * true again on the next 10 Hz status message and the deck restarts in a loop
 * around a banner nobody has read.

/**
 * =========================================================================
 * KEYBOARD. DESIGN §11, trimmed to the one deck this build has.
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT THE BINDING, IT IS THE FOCUS. This deck is a
 * cross-origin `chrome-extension://` iframe inside somebody else's page, and a
 * key event never crosses that boundary. In the gesture the feature exists for
 * — the user clicks YouTube's play button and then reaches for a digit — focus
 * is on the YOUTUBE document, where YouTube's own handler reads 1-9 as
 * seek-to-percentage. A listener in the deck alone is a feature that works only
 * after you have clicked the deck.
 *
 * So there are two entry points and this file serves both:
 *
 *   1. `content.js`, capture phase on the host page. It decides only WHETHER to
 *      intercept, from `hostKeys()` below, and forwards the event to the deck.
 *   2. `embed.js`, the deck's own document, when the frame already has focus.
 *
 * Both then call `shortcut()`, which is where what-the-key-does lives. The
 * split is deliberate: the host has to answer "is this ours" BEFORE it can call
 * `preventDefault`, and it cannot import this file (a content script is a
 * classic script in an isolated world). `hostKeys()` is therefore SENT to it —
 * the deck posts the list, the host stores it — so the two entry points cannot
 * disagree about which keys we take.
 */

/**
 * WHY 1-6 ARE CONDITIONAL AND SPACE IS NOT TAKEN AT ALL.
 *
 * We are a guest on YouTube's page. `content.js` only intercepts these while a
 * deck is ARMED (product ruling): with no deck, YouTube's seek-to-percentage must
 * behave exactly as it does with the extension uninstalled.
 *
 * ONE DIGIT PER STRIP, SIX STRIPS, SIX DIGITS — ratified 2026-08-17,
 * retiring the `Digit5`-`Digit8` carve-out. That carve-out was written when this
 * surface had FOUR strips and `5`-`8` was deck B's block on the console; the
 * console went, the sixth stem landed, and the clause was never revisited. Its
 * stated reason — a key we take is a key YouTube stops getting — is true, and it
 * does not distinguish `5` from `1`: this build had already spent `1`-`4` and
 * `0` on exactly that trade. A rack where two of six strips are pointer-only is
 * the artifact, not the policy. `7` `8` `9` still reach YouTube's
 * seek-to-70/80/90 %, which is where the trade now sits.
 *
 * NOT HERE, and each absence is a decision rather than an omission:
 *   7 8 9       the surviving seek digits. Six strips need six keys and no more,
 *               so these are the ones the page keeps — the boundary is
 *               `KEYED_STEMS` below and it is asserted at both entry points.
 *   Q W E R T Y the crossfader assign matrix, which this build does not have
 *   A S D F G H the console's per-stem solo row (new with six stems). Shift+1-6
 *               is solo HERE, because there is no deck B for Shift to name.

 *   `           deck focus, with one deck
 *   Space       YouTube's transport is the ONLY transport in this build
 *               (ARCHITECTURE §6.5). Taking it would put two controls on one

 * accessible name. A sighted Mac user was never affected here; a screen-reader
 * one was.
 *
 * AND OFF A GLYPH PLATFORM IT IS NOT WORK, WHICH IS WHY THE SEPARATOR IS
 * SHARED. `modLabel()` already returns `text === say` for every modifier it
 * spells in words, so the only thing that could ever have made the two strings
 * differ off a Mac was the JOIN — and it did, for every chord with a modifier
 * in it. That is not a cosmetic difference: `welcome.js` keys `role="img"` +
 * `aria-label` on `say !== text`, so a chord already drawn as `Ctrl+Shift+9`
 * was announced as a graphic named "Ctrl Shift 9" — the visible text
 * suppressed and nothing gained, on every non-Mac machine. The announced form
 * therefore uses the separator that is DRAWN, and a space stands in only where
 * nothing is drawn between the glyphs, because "ControlShift9" is not an
 * instruction either. `say !== text` then means exactly "this platform draws
 * glyphs", which is the question the caller is actually asking.
 *
 * TOKENISING TAKES BOTH FORMS. `'+'` separates manifest tokens; Apple glyphs
 * are simply concatenated, so leading glyph characters are peeled off one at a
 * time. `rest.length > 1` stops the last token — the key itself — from being
 * eaten even in the impossible case that it is a glyph.
 *
 * `null` WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SPELL — no command, or a command with no
 * chord bound — because the caller's fallback ("set one at
 * chrome://extensions/shortcuts") is a different sentence, not an empty key
 * cap. An unbound chord rendered as `''` is the failure this returns null for.

 *
 * KEY-LOCKED, NOT VARISPEED. The page's own `<video>` does the work — the same
 * `playbackRate` YouTube's own speed menu writes, with `preservesPitch` left
 * TRUE — so the TEMPO moves and the key does not. Nothing here resamples
 * anything of ours and nothing here is on the capture->model path, which is what
 * CONTRIBUTING.md's absolute prohibition covers.
 *
 * SPEED IS KEY-LOCKED, reversing an earlier varispeed design. This paragraph used
 * to say the pitch followed the speed the way a turntable does, and it did:
 * `content.js::driveRate` cleared `preservesPitch` on every write, the element
 * rendered transposed audio, and the capture tap sits DOWNSTREAM of it — so the
 * separator was fed the wrong key and TRANSPOSE was the manual undo. TRANSPOSE
 * is now the only control that moves the key, at any speed, and the two compose.
 * `qa/speed-pitch.mjs` holds it at ±2 cents.
 *
 * THE STEP IS A MUSICAL INTERVAL, NOT A PERCENTAGE, and that survives the
 * reversal — but for a smaller reason than it used to have. 2 % steps across a
 * 4x range would be ~70 presses end to end; nudge buttons cannot carry that, and
 * the fix is not a second widget. A third of a semitone near home (which
 * DISPLAYS as the 2 % grid the sync-correction note in embed.js argues about)
 * and a whole semitone outside it gives ~29 rungs with a usable feel at both
 * ends. What it is NO LONGER for is composing with TRANSPOSE: under varispeed
 * each rung was a pitch the user could cancel by hand, and the geometric spacing
 * made that arithmetic exact. Nothing is transposed now, so the ladder's ratios
 * are a STEP SIZE and not an interval anyone hears. Do not re-derive a musical
 * meaning from this array.
 *
 * THERE IS NO STEP CONSTANT, BECAUSE THE STEP IS NOT CONSTANT. `SPEED_M` is the

 * FAR FROM 1.00x — far enough that the stems' roughness is worth disclosing?
 *
 * WHAT THIS USED TO MEAN, AND WHY IT CHANGED (2026-08-17). Under varispeed
 * this function answered "is there still a remedy?": the rate transposed the
 * audio, TRANSPOSE could put the key back inside ±6 semitones, and past that
 * the shifter had no ratio left. That question no longer exists — the rate
 * transposes nothing and there is nothing to put back.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEANS NOW is one thing only: the element phase-vocodes at every rate
 * off 1.00x, so the separator meets smeared material and the stems come back
 * rougher the further you push. That cost is REAL AT EVERY NON-UNITY RATE and it
 * grows continuously — there is no cliff in the physics — so this threshold is a
 * DISCLOSURE JUDGEMENT about when it is worth a sentence, not a boundary in the
 * signal. It must keep meaning "you pushed it" and never "you used the feature"
 * (CONTRIBUTING.md settles that for the clip indicator; the same logic governs here),
 * which is why it is silent at 0.75x and speaks at 0.63x.
 *
 * ponytail: THE NUMBER IS STILL SPELLED `SEMITONE_MIN`/`SEMITONE_MAX` AND THAT
 * IS NOW A COINCIDENCE, NOT A DERIVATION. Those constants are TRANSPOSE's clamp
 * and are pinned to `engine/pitch.js` at the foot of this file, which is still
 * correct FOR TRANSPOSE — but nothing ties the shifter's reach to where speed
 * roughness deserves a warning any more. Ceiling: widening `pitch.js` to ±7
 * would silently move this disclosure line, which is the entry-point family
 * again — one constant, right for one caller, coincidental for the other.
 * Upgrade path: give this its own `SPEED_FAR_M` (in the ladder's thirty-sixths,
 * so it is the array's unit) and drop the borrow. Held rather than done because
 * the VALUE is ratified behaviour — silent at 0.75x, speaking at 0.63x — and
 * changing where the number lives is a separate change from changing what it is.
 *
 * IT IS SYMMETRIC IN THE LADDER'S OWN UNIT even though it looks lopsided in
 * percent: 0.707x and 1.414x are the same distance from home in ratio, and
 * percent is not the axis. That is why `semitones` still comes back — it is the
 * RUNG COORDINATE, the array's exponent over three, and it is not a pitch

 * THE KEY READOUT — may we show one, and what may we show?
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not decide the key, and it does not hold a
 * hysteresis gate. `extension/engine/chroma.js` owns both (`createKeyDisplay`,
 * `DISPLAY_POLICY`) and the engine runs them, because the gate needs the full
 * 24-way `scores` vector to compare a challenger against the INCUMBENT and the
 * wire carries only the winner. A second gate here would be a second opinion
 * about the same signal, on data that cannot support one.
 *
 * What it does own is the one thing a view must never get wrong: WHEN THE
 * PAYLOAD CANNOT BE READ, SAY SO. `displayKey()` throws on a bad tonic, a bad
 * mode or an unknown state — so a view that guards with `key && key.tonic` and
 * otherwise renders nothing would show an empty, healthy-looking readout on
 * precisely the runs where the engine sent something wrong. That is the
 * `!x || (check)` shape AGENTS.md has four logged instances of, one level up in
 * the UI. `bad` is a visible state.
 *
 * @param {{state?:string, concertTonic?:number, mode?:string, confidence?:number}|null} key
 *   the engine's `key` field on LIVE_STATE. ABSENT is not an error: an engine
 *   that has not started has nothing to say about the key.

   * fidelity threshold IS the engine's range", chaining speedFar's boundary onto
   * the same constants. Under varispeed that was causal: past the shifter's
   * reach the user could no longer undo the rate's transposition. Under key lock
   * the rate transposes nothing, so speedFar's threshold is a disclosure
   * judgement that merely happens to be spelled with these constants — see the
   * `ponytail:` on speedFar. Do not read the pin below as evidence for it.
   *
   * THE DETECTOR'S SEARCH RANGE IS PINNED THE SAME WAY. Same dynamic import,
   * same reason it cannot be a static one, same rule that a failure to load is
   * reported as a FAILED comparison rather than swallowed.
