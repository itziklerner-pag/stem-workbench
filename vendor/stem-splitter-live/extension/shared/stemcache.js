/**
 * Stem cache — the thing that makes Mode 3 possible.
 *
 * Two live decks do not fit: measured p95(A+B) 2496 ms against a 1950 ms
 * deadline, 0.78x margin, deck B 58 % separated (`tools/dual-live-probe.mjs`).
 * A CACHED deck costs 0 % GPU and has zero latency, so Mode 3 is one live deck
 * plus one cached deck. docs/AUDIO.md §8.3 called this from first principles
 * before any live code existed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORMAT — 16-bit PCM, and only for playback.
 *
 * Export always re-derives from the model at 32f, so no lossy artefact can ever
 * reach a deliverable; the cache is a playback convenience and nothing else.
 * 16-bit is ~254 MB/track at six stems (169 MB at four) against ~508 MB for 32f,
 * which doubles how many tracks fit under a given cap. Stems are more revealing
 * of codec artefacts than full mixes (no masking material), which is why this is
 * PCM and not Opus — AUDIO.md §8.3 puts the floor at 128 kbps/stem if that ever
 * changes.
 *
 * Dither: NO. `encodeWav` dithers by default and that is right for a
 * deliverable, but this file is read back and summed with its siblings, so
 * `STEMS.length` independent TPDF noise floors would add — and that argument got
 * STRONGER at six stems, not weaker. The stems must also sum to the mix the way
 * the model produced them. `dither: false` is deliberate.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * KEY — videoId + pipeline version.
 *
 * A pipeline change MUST invalidate. Silently-stale stems are the worst class of
 * bug this project can ship: they sound plausible, they are wrong, and nothing
 * in the UI can tell you. `pipelineVersion()` folds in everything that changes
 * the samples — the model hash, the segment geometry, the seam crossfade law,
 * and the hop, because cached stems come from ONE REAL-TIME PASS through the
 * causal window and that window is hop-dependent (a 1.95 s hop and a 3.9 s hop
 * produce measurably different stems: corr 0.9909 vs 0.9938 against offline).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PRIMING IS ONE REAL-TIME PASS AND CANNOT BE SPED UP. Raising
 * `video.playbackRate` still captures at 48 kHz, so at 3x everything above
 * 8 kHz is gone; `preservesPitch` phase-vocodes exactly the fine structure the
 * separator relies on. Design the UX around "prime this while the previous
 * track plays" (AUDIO.md §8.3), never around a trick.
