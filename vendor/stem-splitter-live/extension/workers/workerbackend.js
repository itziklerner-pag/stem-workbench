/**
 * BACKEND #1 — today's inference worker, behind the seam.
 *
 * `inference.worker.js`, its neighbour, is untouched by this file: ONNX Runtime on
 * WebGPU with a threaded-wasm fallback, the ~283 ms/segment JS STFT/iSTFT around
 * the hoisted-STFT ONNX graph, one ORT session, one wasm instance. What moved
 * here is everything that used to sit in `offscreen/deck.js` between the deck
 * and that worker: the five-message protocol, the pending map that correlates
 * `INFER` with `RESULT`, the three destinations an `ERROR` has, and the ORT
 * presence probe. The deck kept what is orchestration — session state, the
 * `state.model` mirror, and the GPU scheduler.
 *
 * WHY THAT LINE AND NOT ANOTHER. Seed §16 chose the AUDIO-level seam (option S2)
 * over a tensor-level one precisely so that the spectral path — the slowest
 * stage on WebGPU — is INSIDE the thing a native backend would replace, rather
 * than frozen into the interface in front of it. So `demucs.js`, the STFT, the
 * tensor names and the `[1,4,2048,336]` complex-as-channels packing are all
 * below this file and none of them is on `Backend`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠ THE ZERO-COPY TRANSFER RULE — quoted, because this file is where it lives
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `offscreen/deck.js`, on the demotion path:
 *
 *     "When demoted, mixBuf/outBuf are NEVER transferred, so the caller still
 *      owns them. That invariant is load-bearing — see LivePipeline.runChunk."
 *
 * `offscreen/live.js`, on the other side of the same fact:
 *
 *     "NOTHING WAS TRANSFERRED — the scheduler returns before postMessage — so
 *      mixBuf/outBuf are still attached and must NOT be reallocated or
 *      reclaimed."
 *
 * There are exactly THREE transfers in the whole inference path and this file
 * owns two of them:
 *
 *   1. `LOAD_MODEL` posts `[buffer]` — 114,559,139 B of weights, transferred
 *      because the alternative is 109 MB duplicated across a thread boundary at
 *      the exact peak-memory moment (FINDINGS §3 measured 1761 MB renderer RSS
 *      with the duplicate resident).
 *   2. `INFER` posts `[mix, out]` — 2.75 MB + 16.51 MB, LENT for one segment.
 *   3. (the worker's own `RESULT` hands both straight back, because
 *      `inference.worker.js:105` wraps `m.out` in a VIEW rather than copying it,
 *      so `r.stems.buffer === m.out`.)
 *
 * The pair PING-PONGS: `LivePipeline` allocates them ONCE PER SESSION — "19.4 MB
 * at six stems, once" — and re-adopts them from every resolution. And the
 * demotion path must transfer NOTHING, which is a property of WHERE the transfer
 * sits rather than of a flag: `postMessage` is inside `separate()`, `separate()`
 * is inside `gpu.run()`'s `fn`, and every demotion returns BEFORE `fn` is called
 * (`deck.js`'s pre-emptive L3, `scheduler.js:185`, `scheduler.js:194`). If a
 * future backend transferred on the demotion path, the next `runChunk` would
 * throw "Cannot perform Construct on a detached ArrayBuffer" at its first line,
 * once per capture tick, for ever.
 *
 * DO NOT CHANGE WHICH BUFFERS ARE TRANSFERRED AND WHICH ARE NOT.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT IS UNIT CODE THAT NO IMPORT CRAWL OF THE UNIT REACHES — read this before
 * computing the unit's file list
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This file's ONLY importer in the tree is `offscreen/host.js`, the Host, which
 * is a declared HOLE in the unit. So a crawl that starts at
 * `offscreen/engine.js` and stops at the Host — which is what a hole means —
 * misses this file, and with it `workers/inference.worker.js`,
 * `engine/demucs.js`, the tensor contract and the six-stem layout: the most
 * unit-ish code in the repository, sitting behind the one edge a crawl must not
 * follow. `inference.worker.js` has the same property for a different reason
 * (`new URL(..., import.meta.url)` is not an import either), which is why
 * ADR 0001 decision 3 enumerates the unit's worker files BY NAME rather than by
 * graph. `workerbackend.js` is named there too, as of S6.
 *
 * A closure computed rather than listed must therefore SEED this file
 * explicitly. It is the Host's choice of backend and the unit's implementation
 * of one at the same time: which is the point of the seam, and the reason the
 * two facts have to be written down separately.

   * engine's `onTeardown` runs at `pagehide` and returns immediately (R5). The
   * `async` keyword is the interface's, not this implementation's.
   *
   * THE `DISPOSE` MESSAGE IS GONE, AND THAT IS THE DECISION RATHER THAN AN
   * OVERSIGHT. `deck.js` used to post it and call `terminate()` in the same
   * task, so `inference.worker.js`'s handler — an `await engine.session.release()`
   * — had no task to run in and essentially never ran; the second teardown path,
   * `pagehide`, never posted it at all. There is no ack on the wire to await,
   * either, so "post and hope" was the only shape available and it was
   * indistinguishable from not posting. `terminate()` is what actually releases
   * the ~1.7 GB wasm heap, and it is unconditional. A backend that CAN
   * acknowledge a graceful shutdown should await one here; this one cannot, so
   * it says so instead of pretending.
   *
   * IT SETTLES EVERYTHING IT TAKES AWAY, AND THAT IS A BEHAVIOUR CHANGE RATHER
   * THAN A PORT (S8, #9). `deck.js` cleared the pending map without rejecting it
   * and this file inherited that: every call in flight at teardown was left
   * unsettled for ever. Nothing times an inference out and there is no cancel
   * path, so `await separate(...)` inside `LivePipeline.runChunk` simply never
   * returned — Review finding M1 arriving through the one door `die()` does not
   * cover, because a deliberate teardown is not a death.
   *
   * IT IS NOT `die()`, for exactly that reason. `die()` announces through
   * `onFail`, and `Deck`'s `onFail` latches `session = 'error'` and logs
   * `ERROR [deck A backend]`. Giving a backend back on purpose is not an error
   * and must not be reported as one, so the rejection here is silent to
   * everything except the calls it settles.
   *
   * THE REASON IS RECORDED AS WELL AS THROWN, for the calls that arrive after
   * this. `require()` is what refuses those, out of `deadReason`; without a
   * reason recorded here it would tell a caller the backend "is not running and
   * reported no reason" about a teardown this very method performed. Since S8
   * the seam refuses them one layer up as well — `serialiseBackend`'s own
   * `dispose()` — so this is defence in depth rather than the only guard; it
   * stays because it is THIS backend's duty on the `Backend` typedef, and a
   * backend that only refuses when something else is holding its coat has not
   * discharged it.
   *
   * ...AND THE RUNTIME PROBE GOES WITH IT. `load()` awaits `this.probe` BEFORE
   * it calls `require()`, so a probe left behind answers first: on a checkout
   * with no `extension/vendor/ort/`, a `load()` reaching a disposed backend said
   * "ONNX Runtime is missing from this build — run `bash tools/fetch-vendor.sh`"
   * about a backend that was deliberately given back. That is the same
   * wrong-cause failure `deadReason` exists to prevent, one line above the line
   * that reads it. `spawn()` re-runs the probe, and nothing else reads it.
   *
   * BOTH MESSAGES NAME THE BACKEND. Two decks own one each, they fail
   * independently, and "the inference worker is gone" names neither.
   *
   * WHAT THE IN-FLIGHT REJECTION LOOKS LIKE FROM THE DECK, since this crosses
   * "the extension behaves identically" on purpose and the reader deserves the
   * whole route rather than its first frame. `live.js:864` catches it as
   * `fail('CHUNK_FAILED', e)`, and `fail()` does more than log: it puts
   * `{type:'LIVE_ERROR', code:'CHUNK_FAILED'}` on the wire, `CHUNK_FAILED` is
   * NOT in the console's `ADVISORY_CODES`, and `embed.js` therefore paints a
   * fatal banner with a Restart button. Neither suppression path fires —
   * `fail()`'s early-out needs `status === 'error' && stopped` and
   * `LivePipeline.stop()` leaves `status = 'idle'`, and `runChunk`'s
   * `gen !== this.gen` early return cannot fire because only `start()` bumps
   * `gen`. So: one banner where there used to be a promise that never settled.
   * In the shipped build that is close to unreachable — the only route to
   * `Deck.dispose()` is the `TEARDOWN` message, which nothing in `extension/`
   * sends, and `host.onTeardown` runs at `pagehide` with the document dying —
   * but it IS reachable through `engine.js`'s `DEV_DECK_DISPOSE` probe hook,
   * where a fault-injection harness now sees one deck-level fault it did not see
   * before. A hang reported as nothing was the worse of the two.
